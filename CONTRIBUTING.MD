# Contributing

Welcome to our contributing guide! We're excited to have you as a contributor.

## Releasing

Packages are published on the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Each
release is associated to a github tag.

A version is composed of three numbers: `X.Y.Z` where `X` is the major version,
`Y` is the minor version and `Z` is the patch version.

A tag is a label that is applied to a version. It can be used to identify a
version as a beta, or other version.

Combined together, a version and a tag can be used to identify a package
release.

Example:

- `v1.0.0` is the first release of the `1.0.0` version.
- `v1.0.0-beta1` is the first `beta` release of the `1.0.0` version.

We have some rules in place to make sure that the version numbers and tags are
correct.

### Publishing packages

Publishing packages is done by running the
[**Publish packages**](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/actions/workflows/publish-packages.yml)
workflow.

1. Run the workflow with the appropriate git tag.
2. Validate that the workflow published the packages to the npm registry.

To run a release in github (for `main` and `beta` branches):

3. Create a new release on github using the URL provided at the end of the
   workflow.
4. Add the release notes
5. Update CHANGELOG.md

### Latest releases

Latest releases are stable and production ready.

We release packages under the `latest` npm tag using the following format:

- github tag: `vX.Y.Z`
- version: `X.Y.Z`
- npm tag: `latest`

Latest releases are only published from the `main` branch.

### Beta releases

Beta releases are near-stable and close to production ready.

We release packages under the `beta` npm tag using the following format:

- github tag: `vX.Y.Z-betaN`
- version: `X.Y.Z-betaN`
- npm tag: `beta`

Beta releases are only published from the `beta` branch.

### Other releases

Other releases are not stable and not production ready.

We release packages under the desired npm tag using the following format:

- github tag: `vX.Y.Z-<tag>N`
- version: `X.Y.Z-<tag>N`
- npm tag: `<tag>`

Other releases are published from any branch.
