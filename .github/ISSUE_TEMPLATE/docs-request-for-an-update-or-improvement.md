**What is the improvement or update you wish to see?**

Ex. I would like to see more examples of how to use the `updateMyPresence` 
React Hook.

**Is there any context that might help us understand?**

Ex. Can I call the `updateMyPresence` function with other parameters than
cursors position?

**Does the docs page already exist? Please link to it.**

Ex. [https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react)
