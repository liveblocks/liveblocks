# Examples

This directory contains all collaborative examples showcased on
[liveblocks.io/examples](https://liveblocks.io/examples).

## Using the examples

All examples are their own local packages. They don't depend on anything else in
this monorepo. As such, you can just run `npm install` and `npm run dev` in any
of them to try them out. Donâ€™t forget to check out the individual example
READMEs for instructions on how to set up your Liveblocks keys.

## Linking examples to the _local_ Liveblocks packages

If you are contributing to one of the core Liveblocks packages and want to try
your changes against any of the examples, take the following steps:

1. Change the dependency version in `examples/whatever-example/package.json` to
   `"*"` instead of an explicit version number:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "@liveblocks/client": "*",  ðŸ‘ˆ
       "@liveblocks/node": "*",    ðŸ‘ˆ
       "@liveblocks/react": "*",   ðŸ‘ˆ
       ...
     }
   }
   ```
2. Declare the example as an NPM workspace, in the `package.json` in the root of
   the monorepo:
   ```json
   {
     "workspaces": [
       "shared/*",
       "packages/*",
       "e2e/next-sandbox",
       "examples/whatever-example",  ðŸ‘ˆ
     ]
   }
   ```
3. Run `npm install` from the root of this monorepo.
4. Run `turbo run build` in the root of this monorepo.
5. Now the example is linked to the local Liveblocks source code.
6. Remember to NOT (!) check in the changes to the `package.json` files. Itâ€™s
   fine to develop against a locally linked package, but we want to keep the
   examples linked against _published_ versions of Liveblocks at all times.
