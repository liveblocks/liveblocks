# [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io) × [React](https://reactjs.org/).

This project shows how to build a collaborative to-do list with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

As users edit the list, changes will be automatically persisted and synced, allowing for a list that updates in real-time across clients. Users will also be able to see who else is currently online and when a user is typing.

You can also follow our [step by step tutorial](https://liveblocks.io/docs/tutorials/multiplayer-to-do-list/react) to build it from scratch.

## Getting started

### Run examples locally

- Install all dependencies with `npm install`

- Create an account on [liveblocks.io](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard)

- Copy your public key from the [administration](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/apikeys)

- Replace the constant PUBLIC_KEY in `src/index.js` with your own public key.
