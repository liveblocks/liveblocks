This example shows how to build a collaborative to-do list with [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

As users edit the list, changes will be automatically persisted and syncedâ€”allowing for a list that updates in real-time across native apps. Users will also be able to see who else is currently online and when a user is typing.
