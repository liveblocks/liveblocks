# [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io) Ã— [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).

This project shows how to build a collaborative to-do list with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).

As users edit the list, changes will be automatically persisted and synced, allowing for a list that updates in real-time across clients. Users will also be able to see who else is currently online and when a user is typing.

You can also follow our [step by step tutorial](https://liveblocks.io/docs/tutorials/multiplayer-to-do-list/react-zustand) to build it from scratch.
