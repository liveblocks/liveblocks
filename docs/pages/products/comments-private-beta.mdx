Embed a customizable commenting experience into your product to enable people to
collaborate. Liveblocks Comments is fully customizable, enabling you to create
all kinds of commenting experiences that look and feel like your product. With
comments, you can build things like mentions, thread resolution, text
annotations, video annotations, and more.

<Banner title="Private beta">

Comments is currently in private beta and is only available to a select group of
users. If you want to participate in the beta,
[sign up for the waitlist](https://forms.gle/xgp54aTMsoH8hrjU9). During this
beta period, breaking changes may occur, but no data loss. We use beta testers‚Äô
feedback to improve our product. Your input is important and helps us shape the
final version.

## Features

### UserId

For comments to function, Liveblocks only needs to store your users‚Äô IDs. Your
user data remains on your server, giving you full control and ownership of it.
Any changes made to your app, such as profile updates or user deletions, do not
need to be mirrored in Liveblocks.

```tsx
{
    "type": "comment",
    "threadId": "th_hhhFMlEx4whFcV0EJJ4o9",
    "roomId": "my-room",
    "id": "cm_hhhFMlEx3whFcV0EJJ4o9",
    "userId": "user1", // üëà Your user‚Äôs identification
    "createdAt": "2023-07-04T20:40:28.068Z",
    "body": {
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "paragraph",
                "children": [
                    {
                        "text": "Hello world!"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "mentionedIds": []
},
```

```tsx
resolveUser: async (userId) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users?userId=${userId}`); // üëà your own logic to fetch user information

      return response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  },
```

### Webhooks

Webhooks are the foundation for extending Liveblocks in any way you want. You
can subscribe to any comments-related events, such as creation, edition and
deletion.

```tsx
{
  type: "commentCreated",
  data: {
    projectId: "acmeinc",
    roomId: "besttrips2023",
    threadId: "th_hhhFMlEx4whFcV0EJJ4o9",
    commentId: "cm_hhhFMlEx3whFcV0EJJ4o9",
    createdAt: "2023-07-04T20:40:28.068Z",
    createdBy: "florent.l",
  }
```

With Webhooks, you can leverage your own email marketing tool to send emails,
apply your product‚Äôs branding, choose your notification strategy, or even
synchronize threads in Slack.

### Opinionated components and Primitives

To integrate the Comments feature, you have two primary design implementation
pathways:

#### Opinionated components

- Our components are designed to be easily integrated using plug-and-play
  functionality.
- You‚Äôll benefit from our team‚Äôs UX and UI expertise incorporated into these
  components.
- Although our components have a default style, you can adjust the CSS to meet
  your needs.
- We constantly improve and update our components to ensure they are optimized
  and current.

```tsx
function App() {
  const threads = useThreads();

  return (
    <>
      {threads.map((thread) => (
        <Thread key={thread.id} thread={thread} />
      ))}
      <Composer />
    </>
  );
}
```

#### Primitives

- Unstyled components.
- Accessible building blocks to fully customize the experience if CSS is not
  enough.
- Available hooks to access all the context of your threads and comments.

```tsx
// TO BE ADDED
```

Note that these two options are not separate paths. Both approaches can be
combined to suit your needs for both speed (opinionated components) and
customization (primitives). One could imagine building their own thread
component from scratch using our primitives but still using our opinionated
`<Composer />` component.

### Metadata

With metadata available at the threads level, you can tailor your commenting
experience to your specific needs by refining and shaping it.

Some examples of custom requirements include:

- Anchor threads to specific spots on your platform for contextual discussions
  linked to any aspect of your product.
- Label your threads based on your business logic, like status, priority and
  category.

```tsx
{
    "type": "thread",
    "id": "th_hhhFMlEx4whFcV0EJJ4o9",
    "roomId": "my-room",
    "comments": [...],
    "createdAt": "2023-07-04T19:23:09.983Z",
    "metadata": { // üëà Metadata associated with the thread
        "location": "#image-3",
        "resolved": true
    },
    "updatedAt": "2023-08-09T15:42:59.135Z" // üëà When was the thread last updated
}
```

### Deletion

Comments are not deleted, only the body. We keep a placeholder so that the
missing comment can still be noticed, giving you the option on how to display
deleted comments; either through a clear ‚Äúmessage deleted‚Äù indicator or by not
displaying it. Note that we only delete a thread when all its comments have been
deleted.

```tsx
{
    "type": "comment",
    "threadId": "th_hhhFMlEx4whFcV0EJJ4o9",
    "roomId": "my-room",
    "id": "cm_h34Ed2DB2Nml1f33JhRo9",
    "userId": "user1",
    "createdAt": "2023-07-09T11:23:55.388Z",
    "editedAt": "2023-08-01T18:43:21.566Z",
    "deletedAt": "2023-08-09T15:39:35.567Z" // üëà When was the comment deleted
}
```

### Radix: inspiration

Our admiration for Radix runs deep. Their approach to low-level components has
been a beacon of inspiration as we crafted our suite of tools.

- We prioritize making our components usable for everyone.
- Our components are designed for complete stylistic customization without
  default style constraints. They are also modular, allowing for easy
  combination and extensibility.
- We minimize dependencies to ensure our components remain efficient and
  lightweight.
