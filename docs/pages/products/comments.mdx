## Philosophy

Learn more about the overall philosophy for Liveblocks Comments through a few
opinions and design decisions. Comments is meant to be fully customizable,
enabling you to create all kinds of commenting experiences that look and feel
like your product. With Comments, you can build things like mentions, thread
resolution, text annotations, video annotations, and more.

### No need to synchronize your users’ info with Liveblocks

When posting a comment, we do not store the author name or avatar. We only store
the author ID. We believe that it’s easier for you to retrieve users metadata
when needed instead of synchronizing your database of users with Liveblocks.

```tsx
createRoomContext(client, {
  resolveUser: async ({ userId }) => {
    // Fetch user metadata from a local cache or a backend endpoint

    return {
      name: "Marie Curie",
      avatar: "/images/marie-curie.png",
    };
  },
});
```

### Metadata

With metadata available at the threads level, you can tailor your commenting
experience to your specific needs by refining and shaping it.

Some examples of custom requirements include:

- Anchor threads to specific spots on your platform for contextual discussions
  linked to any aspect of your product.
- Label your threads based on your business logic, like status, priority and
  category.

```tsx
// Example to annotate a video at a specific timestamp
createThread({
  body,
  metadata: {
    timestamp: 42,
  },
});

// Example to start a thread on a specific element in your document
createThread({
  body,
  metadata: {
    elementId: "xxx",
  },
});
```

### Deletion

Deleting a comment from the client only soft deletes it: `comment.body` is
removed and `comment.deletedAt` is added. We keep a placeholder so that the
missing comments can still be noticed, giving you the choice on how to display
deleted comments: either through a clear “message deleted” indicator or by not
displaying it. Note that a thread is fully deleted when all its comments have
been deleted.

### Components

To build comments in your application, you have two primary design
implementation pathways:

#### Default components

- The default components are designed to be easily integrated as plug-and-play.
- They come with customizable but optional (and overridable) default styles,
  including support for dark mode.
- They are opinionated with a few options, you’ll benefit from our UX and UI
  expertise incorporated into these components.

```tsx file="App.tsx" highlight="2,9,11"
import { useThreads } from "./liveblocks.config";
import { Composer, Thread } from "@liveblocks/react-comments";

export function App() {
  const { threads } = useThreads();
  return (
    <div>
      {threads.map((thread) => (
        <Thread key={thread.id} thread={thread} />
      ))}
      <Composer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Primitives

- Headless, unstyled components.
- Accessible building blocks to fully customize the experience if CSS is not
  enough.

```tsx file="CustomComment.tsx" highlight="1,8,10"
import { Comment, Timestamp } from "@liveblocks/react-comments/primitives";

export function CustomComment({ comment }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <span>{comment.userId}</span>
        <Timestamp date={comment.createdAt} />
      </div>
      <Comment.Body body={comment.body} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

##### Inspired by Radix

Our admiration for [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) runs deep. Their approach
to low-level components has been a beacon of inspiration as we crafted the
primitives.

- We prioritize making the components usable for everyone.
- The components are designed for complete stylistic customization without
  default style constraints. They are also modular, allowing for easy
  combination and extensibility.
- We minimize dependencies to ensure the components remain efficient and
  lightweight.

#### Combining default components and primitives

Note that these two options are not separate paths. Both approaches can be
combined to suit your needs for both speed (default components) and
customization (primitives). One could imagine building their own `<Comment />`
component from scratch using the primitives and still use the default
`<Composer />` component.

### Webhooks

Webhooks are the foundation for extending Liveblocks in any way you want. You
can subscribe to any comments-related events, such as creation, edition and
deletion.

With Webhooks, you can leverage your own email marketing tool to send emails,
apply your product’s branding, choose your notification strategy, or even
synchronize threads in Slack.

To use our Webhooks, please follow [our guide](/docs/platform/webhooks) and/or
take a look at our
[example specific to comments events](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/comments/examples/nextjs-comments/src/app/api/webhooks/route.ts).
