Notifications are a key part of a commenting experience, learn how to add them
to your product in different ways:
[by adding a notifications inbox to your app](#notifications-inbox),
[by differentiating unread comments in threads](#unread-indicators), and
[by also notifying users via email](#email-notifications).

## Notifications inbox

Add a notifications inbox to your app to keep users informed about the threads
they are participating in with unread comments, mentions, and more.

An inbox as shown above can be built (and customized) using a combination of
hooks and components.

### LiveblocksContext

Comments—as many other Liveblocks features—takes place inside rooms.
Notifications on the other hand, are global and accessible without entering
rooms. This means that Notifications isn’t available on
[`createRoomContext`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#createRoomContext)
and within [`RoomProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RoomProvider),
but instead on
[`createLiveblocksContext`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#createLiveblocksContext)
and within
[`LiveblocksProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProvider).

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="2,10-11"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { createRoomContext, createLiveblocksContext } from "@liveblocks/react";

const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
});

export const { RoomProvider, useThreads } = createRoomContext(client);

export const { LiveblocksProvider, useInboxNotifications } =
  createLiveblocksContext(client);
```

Unlike [`RoomProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RoomProvider),
[`LiveblocksProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProvider)
doesn’t call Liveblocks servers when mounted, so it can (and should) live higher
in the component tree of your app. Features outside of rooms like Notifications
can now be used anywhere in your app, without entering rooms.

```tsx
import { LiveList, LiveMap, LiveObject } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { LiveblocksProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";

function AppRoot() {
  return <LiveblocksProvider>{/* children */}</LiveblocksProvider>;
}
```

### useInboxNotifications

To get a list of a user’s notifications, we can use
[`useInboxNotifications`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useInboxNotifications).

```tsx
import { useInboxNotifications } from "./liveblocks.config";

const { inboxNotifications } = useInboxNotifications();
```

Inbox notifications are different from “normal” notifications in the sense that
they can group multiple activities together and evolve over time, which makes
more sense when building a notifications inbox. In the case of Comments, inbox
notifications are grouped per thread, which means that if there are 4 new
comments in a thread you’re participating in, you will have a single inbox
notification for it, instead of 4 “normal” notifications.

By default, you receive inbox notifications for threads you are participating
in: if you create it, comment in it, or if someone mentions you in it. For
example, in the image below, Quinn Elton and Emil Joyce are both participants.

<Figure highlight={35}>
  <Image
    src="/assets/comments/comment-body.png"
    alt="Comment with example body: 'Thank you so much @Emil Joyce!', with 'so much' in bold"
    width={1289}
    height={390}
  />
</Figure>

This behavior can be customized per room, learn more about it in the
[Notifications settings](#notifications-settings) section.

### Components

To display inbox notifications,
[`@liveblocks/react-comments`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments)
comes with two default components:
[`InboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments#InboxNotification)
and
[`InboxNotificationList`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments#InboxNotification).

```tsx
import {
  InboxNotification,
  InboxNotificationList,
} from "@liveblocks/react-comments";
import { useInboxNotifications } from "./liveblocks.config";

function Inbox() {
  const { inboxNotifications } = useInboxNotifications();

  return (
    <InboxNotificationList>
      {inboxNotifications.map((inboxNotification) => (
        <InboxNotification
          key={inboxNotification.id}
          inboxNotification={inboxNotification}
        />
      ))}
    </InboxNotificationList>
  );
}
```

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/comments/inbox-notification-list.png"
    alt="Inbox notifications displayed with InboxNotification and InboxNotificationList"
    width={768}
    height={446}
  />
</Figure>

You can then decide to display this list of notifications in a popover, a
dedicated page, etc.

### Missing pieces

We now have a list of notifications, but we’re missing a few things:

- Display the number of unread notifications (or just a dot) outside of the
  inbox
- Allow users to mark all notifications as read at once

To display the number of unread notifications, you can use
[`useUnreadInboxNotificationsCount`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useUnreadInboxNotificationsCount).

```tsx
const { count } = useUnreadInboxNotificationsCount();

<span className="notifications-inbox-badge">{count}</span>;
```

To mark all notifications as read, you can use
[`useMarkAllInboxNotificationsAsRead`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMarkAllInboxNotificationsAsRead).

```tsx
const markAllInboxNotificationsAsRead = useMarkAllInboxNotificationsAsRead();

<button onClick={markAllInboxNotificationsAsRead}>Mark all as read</button>;
```

That’s it! You now have a fully functional notifications inbox in your app.

## Unread indicators

Threads leverage Notifications behind-the-scenes to keep track of unread
comments so viewing a thread will also mark its inbox notification as read, and
vice versa.

If you use the default
[`Thread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments#Thread) component, it
will automatically handle marking threads as read when they are viewed and show
unread indicators when there are unread comments in threads you are
participating in.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/comments/thread-unread-indicator.png"
    alt="Unread indicator in Thread component"
    width={1456}
    height={896}
  />
</Figure>

If you’re building your own custom `Thread` component, you can use
[`useMarkThreadAsRead`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMarkThreadAsRead)
and
[`useThreadSubscription`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useThreadSubscription)
to replicate (or customize) this behavior.

## Notifications settings

As we’ve seen earlier, by default you receive inbox notifications for threads
you are participating in. This setting can be customized for each user and per
room:

- `"all"` to be notified about everything
- `"replies_and_mentions"` for the default setting
- `"none"` to mute the room

You can use
[`useRoomNotificationSettings`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useRoomNotificationSettings)
to build a settings picker in your app and allow users to change their own
notification settings for the current room, or use
[`updateRoomNotificationSettings`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId-users-userId-notification-settings)
server-side to control them yourself: for example, to automatically make a
document’s author notified about everything in their document.

## Email notifications

Using webhooks, it’s also possible to send updates about a user’s inbox
notifications via email. Learn more about it in the
[dedicated page](/docs/products/comments/email-notifications).
