Using Liveblocks webhooks, it’s possible to trigger your API endpoints when
certain events occur, such as a thread being created, or a comment being
modified. One use for these events is sending unread comment notifications, for
example via email or Slack.

This page is an overview of creating email notifications with Comments. If you’d
prefer a full step-by-step tutorial, make sure to read
[how to send email notifications of unread comments](/docs/guides/how-to-send-email-notifications-of-unread-comments).

If you want to show
[notifications in your app](/docs/products/comments/notification-inbox), you can
use
[`useInboxNotifications`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useInboxNotifications)
and the
[`InboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments#InboxNotification)
component.

## Inbox notifications

Inbox notifications are different from “normal” notifications in the sense that
they group multiple notifications together.

When a user mentions you in a thread, or if you’ve previously participated in
it, then you will have an _inbox notification_ for it. For example, in the image
below, Quinn Elton and Emil Joyce are both participants. As new activities
happen on a thread, the same inbox notification will be updated to always
reflect the thread’s latest state.

## Sending email notifications with webhooks

Using [Liveblocks webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks#Liveblocks-events) you can
listen to a range of events such as comments being deleted, or comment reactions
being added. On [your dashboard](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard) you can create
a webhook for a project, and select which events you’d like to listen to.

The endpoint URL you pass will receive request with relevant data when the event
occurs. The webhook event built for creating these unread notification emails is
called `"threadEmailNotification"`, and by default is sent up to every 30
minutes to each user, though this can be customized in the webhooks dashboard.
Here’s an example of an event object that’s sent when a user receives a new
inbox notification.

```ts
const event = {
  type: "threadEmailNotification",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    threadId: "th_d75sF3...",
    inboxNotificationId: "in_xt3p7ak...",
    userId: "my-user-id",
    createdAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

### Your endpoint

In your endpoint, you can use this `event` object with functions such as
[`liveblocks.getThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId)
and
[`liveblocks.getInboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-users-userId-inboxNotifications-inboxNotificationId),
which will return the thread and inbox notification for the event.

```ts
// Data from the `threadEmailNotification` event
const { roomId, threadId, inboxNotificationId, userId } = event.data;

// Get the thread with the unread comments inside
const thread = await liveblocks.getThread({ roomId, threadId });

// { type: "thread", id: "th_d75sF3...", ... }
console.log(thread);

// Get the inbox notification, which details when the user last read the thread
const inboxNotification = await liveblocks.getInboxNotification({
  inboxNotificationId,
  userId,
});

// { kind: "thread", readAt: Date<2024-07-13T14:32:50.697Z>, ... }
console.log(inboxNotification);
```

Once you have the thread, and the inbox notification, you can use
[`stringifyCommentBody`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#stringify-comment-body)
to transform unread comments into an email-compatible format.

```ts
// Get all unread comments
const unreadComments = thread.comments.filter((comment) =>
  inboxNotification.readAt ? comment.createdAt > inboxNotification.readAt : true
);

// Transform the oldest unread comment into HTML
const commentHtml = await stringifyCommentBody(unreadComments[0].body, {
  format: "html",
});

// "<p>Hello world!</p>"
console.log(commentHtml);
```

You can then send an email containing the comment to the owner of `userId`
received in `event`.

```ts
const emailAddress = __getUserEmail__(userId);

// Send email to the user that received the inbox notification
__sendEmail__({
  from: "hello@my-company.com",
  to: emailAddress,
  title: "Unread comment",
  html: `
    <h1>Unread comment</h1>
    ${commentHtml}
  `,
});
```

Here’s an example with every step linked together, along with the code necessary
to verify a webhook request is valid.

```ts title="Full example" isCollapsable isCollapsed
import {
  Liveblocks,
  WebhookHandler,
  stringifyCommentBody,
} from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When a thread has been created
  if (event.type === "threadCreated") {
    const { roomId, threadId, inboxNotificationId, userId } = event.data;

    // Get the thread with the unread comments inside
    const thread = await liveblocks.getThread({
      roomId,
      threadId,
    });

    // Get the inbox notification, which details when the user last read the thread
    const inboxNotification = await liveblocks.getInboxNotification({
      inboxNotificationId,
      userId,
    });

    // Get all unread comments
    const unreadComments = thread.comments.filter((comment) =>
      inboxNotification.readAt
        ? comment.createdAt > inboxNotification.readAt
        : true
    );

    // Transform the oldest unread comment into HTML
    const commentHtml = await stringifyCommentBody(unreadComments[0].body, {
      format: "html",
    });

    // Send email to the user that received the inbox notification
    const emailAddress = __getUserEmail__(userId);
    __sendEmail__({
      from: "hello@my-company.com",
      to: emailAddress,
      title: "New comment",
      html: `
        <h1>New comment</h1>
        ${commentHtml}
      `,
    });
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

If you’re planning on building this, we recommend learning more in our
[how to send email notifications](/docs/guides/how-to-send-email-notifications-of-unread-comments)
guide, as it’s possible to create much more complex emails than this simple
example.

## Webhook events

There are more webhook events than just the `ThreadEmailNotificationEvent` event
used above—a number related to Comments are available to use.

- [`CommentCreatedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentCreatedEvent)
- [`CommentEditedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentEditedEvent)
- [`CommentDeletedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentDeletedEvent)
- [`CommentReactionAddedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentReactionAddedEvent)
- [`CommentReactionRemovedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentReactionRemovedEvent)
- [`ThreadCreatedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadCreatedEvent)
- [`ThreadMetadataUpdatedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadMetadataUpdatedEvent)

There are also more events, for example you can trigger events when users enter
or leave rooms. We recommend reading our guide on
[testing webhooks locally](/docs/guides/how-to-test-webhooks-on-localhost) to
get started.
