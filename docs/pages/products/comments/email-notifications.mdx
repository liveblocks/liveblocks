Using Liveblocks webhooks, it’s possible to trigger your API endpoints when
certain events occur, such as a thread being created, or a comment being
modified. One use for these events is sending new comment notifications, for
example via email or Slack.

<Banner title="Step-by-step tutorial">

This page is an overview of creating email notifications with Comments. If you’d
prefer a full step-by-step tutorial, make sure to read
[how to send email notifications when comments are created](/docs/guides/how-to-send-email-notifications-when-comments-are-created).

## Sending notifications to particpating users

Using [Liveblocks webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks#Liveblocks-events) you can
listen to a range of events such as comments being deleted, or reactions being
added. On the dashboard you can create a webhook for a project, and select which
events you’d like to listen to.

The endpoint URL will be sent a request with relevant data when the event
occurs. Here’s an example of an event object that’s sent when a thread is
created.

```ts
const event = {
  type: "threadCreated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    threadId: "th_sf8s6sh...",
    createdAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    createdBy: "my-user-id",
  },
};
```

In your endpoint, you can use this `event` object with functions such as
[`liveblocks.getThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId)
and
[`stringifyCommentBody`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#stringify-comment-body),
which will return the thread that’s just been created, and the text from the
first comment.

```ts
const thread = await liveblocks.getThread({
  roomId: event.data.roomId,
  threadId: event.data.threadId,
});

// { type: "thread", id: "th_d75sF3...", ... }
console.log(thread);

const commentText = await stringifyCommentBody(thread.comments[0].body);

// "Hello world!"
console.log(commentText);
```

You could then call [`liveblocks.getParticipants`]() to find a list of user IDs
mentioned in the thread, and send an email to each user.

```ts
const { participantIds } = await liveblocks.getThreadParticipants({
  roomId: event.data.roomId,
  threadId: event.data.threadId,
});

// ["adri@example.com", "florent@example.com"]
console.log(participantIds);

// Send email notifications
for (const userId of participantIds) {
  const emailAddress = __getUserEmail__(userId);

  // Send email to the user using your setup
  __sendEmail__({
    from: "hello@my-company.com",
    to: emailAddress,
    title: "New thread",
    text: `New thread created: ${commentText}`,
  });
}
```

### Full example

Here’s an example with every step linked together, along with the code necessary
to verify a webhook request is valid.

```ts
import { Liveblocks, WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When a thread has been created
  if (event.type === "threadCreated") {
    // Get thread data
    const thread = await liveblocks.getThread({
      roomId: event.data.roomId,
      threadId: event.data.threadId,
    });

    // Get comment text
    const commentText = await stringifyCommentBody(thread.comments[0].body);

    // Get participating userIds
    const { participantIds } = await liveblocks.getThreadParticipants({
      roomId: event.data.roomId,
      threadId: event.data.threadId,
    });

    // Send email notifications
    for (const userId of participantIds) {
      const emailAddress = __getUserEmail__(userId);

      // Send email to the user using your setup
      __sendEmail__({
        from: "hello@my-company.com",
        to: emailAddress,
        title: "New thread",
        text: `New thread created: ${commentText}`,
      });
    }
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

### Webhook events

There’s more than just the `ThreadCreatedEvent` event—a number of different
Comments events are available to use.

- [`CommentCreatedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentCreatedEvent)
- [`CommentEditedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentEditedEvent)
- [`CommentDeletedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentDeletedEvent)
- [`CommentReactionAddedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentReactionAddedEvent)
- [`CommentReactionRemovedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentReactionRemovedEvent)
- [`ThreadCreatedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadCreatedEvent)
- [`ThreadMetadataUpdatedEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadMetadataUpdatedEvent)

There are also more events, for example you can trigger events when users enter
or leave rooms. We recommend reading our guide on
[testing webhooks locally](/docs/guides/how-to-test-webhooks-on-localhost) to
get started.

## Retrieving Comments data

- [`getThreads`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-threads)
- [`getThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-thread)
- [`getThreadParticipants`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-thread-participants)
- [`getComment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-comment)

### Using the REST API

[you can also use the REST API directly]

- [Get thread API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-thread)
- [Get thread participants API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-thread-participants)
- [Get comment API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-comment)
