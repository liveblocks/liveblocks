The primitive components included in Comments are a great way to build complex,
completely custom components. These are headless and unstyled, and can be used
to construct a fully styled comment body and rich-text comment composer.

- Liveblocks functionality, but your own fully custom styles.
- Build custom components for mentions, suggestions, links, and more.
- Composable components that work similarly to
  [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and
  [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/).
- Can be used alongside the
  [default components](/docs/products/comments/default-components).

## Concepts

Each primitive is made up of one or more components, for example
[`Comment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments#primitives-Comment)
only needs `Comment.Body`. This component takes a comment’s body, and turns it
into readable text, with links and mentions.

```tsx highlight="6"
import { CommentData } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { Comment } from "@liveblocks/react-comments/primitives";

// Render a custom comment body
function MyComment({ comment }: { comment: CommentData }) {
  return <Comment.Body body={comment.body} />;
}
```

### Use custom component parts

Many primitives allow you to customize their parts by passing a `components`
property. In this example, we’re modifying links in the comment, so that they’re
purple and bold.

```tsx highlight="13-15,21-28"
import { CommentData } from "@liveblocks/client";
import {
  Comment,
  CommentBodyLinkProps,
} from "@liveblocks/react-comments/primitives";

// Render a custom comment body
function MyComment({ comment }: { comment: CommentData }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Comment.Body
        body={comment.body}
        components={{
          Link,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

// Render a purple link in the comment, e.g. "https://liveblocks.io"
function Link({ href, children }: CommentBodyLinkProps) {
  return (
    <Comment.Link href={href} style={{ color: "purple", fontWeight: 700 }}>
      {children}
    </Comment.Link>
  );
}
```

### Merge with your design system components

You can also add components directly from your design system. Let’s say you have
a `DesignSystemLink` that looks like this.

```tsx
function DesignSystemLink({ url, children }) {
  return (
    <a href={url} target="_blank">
      {children}
    </a>
  );
}
```

If you were to place this inside `Comment.Link`, you’d end up with two `<a>`
elements, which is not valid.

```tsx
<Comment.Link href={href} style={{ color: "purple " }}>
  <DesignSystemLink url={href}>{children}</DesignSystemLink>
</Comment.Link>

// ❌ Renders two separate <a> tags
<a href="https://liveblocks.io" style="color: purple">
  <a href="https://liveblocks.io" target="_blank">https://liveblocks.io</a>
</a>
```

However, if you add the `asChild` property to `Comment.Link`, you can merge the
two components together, and only render a single `<a>` element.

```tsx highlight="1"
<Comment.Link href={href} style={{ color: "purple " }} asChild>
  <DesignSystemLink url={href}>{children}</DesignSystemLink>
</Comment.Link>

// ✅ Renders one combined <a> tag
<a href="https://liveblocks.io" style="color: purple" target="_blank">
  https://liveblocks.io
</a>
```

This is called composability, and almost all Comments primitives are composable
with `asChild`; they forward their props and refs, merge their classes and
styles, and chain their event handlers.
