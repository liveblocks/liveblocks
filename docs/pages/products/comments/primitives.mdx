The primitive components included in Comments are a great way to build complex,
completely custom components. These are headless and unstyled, and can be used
to construct a fully styled comment body and rich-text comment composer.

- Liveblocks functionality, but your own fully custom styles.
- Build custom components for mentions, suggestions, links, and more.
- Composable components that work similarly to
  [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and
  [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/).
- Can be used alongside the
  [default components](/docs/products/comments/default-components).

## Concepts

[show adding mentions to commentbody]

All primitives are composable; they forward their props and refs, merge their
classes and styles, and chain their event handlers.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/my-design-system";

// Use the default <button> element
<Composer.Submit disabled>Send</Composer.Submit>;

// Use an existing custom <Button> component
<Composer.Submit disabled asChild>
  <Button variant="primary">Send</Button>
</Composer.Submit>;
```
