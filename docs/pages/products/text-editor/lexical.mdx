Our Lexical integration provides you with a [React](https://react.dev/) plugin
that adds collaboration to any [Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) text editor. It
also adds realtime cursors, document persistence on the cloud, comments, and
mentions.

## One lexical document per room

- Introduce Room provider?
- Persisted document on our cloud

## Users and Mentions
