A quick overview of the Text Editor packages for Lexical.

## Concepts

Liveblocks Lexical allows you add collaboration to any
[Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) text editor, along with a number of related
features. Each [collaborative room](/docs/concepts/how-liveblocks-works#Rooms)
in your application can store one document each, and these documents are
persisted on the cloud, visible on [your dashboard](/dashboard), and are
integrated into other Liveblocks products such as
[Comments](/docs/products/comments) and
[Notifications](/docs/products/notifications).

## Users and mentions

Users can be added to your document, and you can tag others inline. You can also
easily enable mention suggestions.

    height={874}
  />
</Figure>

Users and mention suggestions can be added with
[`resolveUsers`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProviderResolveUsers),
and
[`resolveMentionSuggestions`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProviderResolveMentionSuggestions).

```tsx highlight="6-13"
import { LiveblocksProvider } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";

function App() {
  return (
    <LiveblocksProvider
      resolveUsers={async ({ userIds }) => {
        // Return user info from their `userIds`
        // ...
      }}
      resolveMentionSuggestions={async ({ text, roomId }) => {
        // Return suggestions from the search `text`
        // ...
      }}
    >
      {/* children */}
    </LiveblocksProvider>
  );
}
```

## Real-time editing

Your document can be edited in real-time by multiple users at once. Each user
renders a cursors on screen that updates live as they move, select, and edit.

    src="/assets/text-editor/cursors.png"
    alt="Real-time text cursors"
    width={1312}
    height={874}
  />
</Figure>

When [authenticating your users](/docs/authentication) with
[`prepareSession`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#access-tokens) or
[`identifyUsers`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#id-tokens), pass `name`
and `color` properties to their `userInfo` to add their cursor information.

```js
userInfo: {
  name: "Marie",
  color: "#00ff00",
}
```

## Annotations and comments

Add [Comments](/docs/products/comments) to your text editor, allowing others to
select words in the editor, and leave annotations. Each annotation creates a
[thread](/docs/products/comments/concepts#Threads), and inside each you can
reply, use emoji reactions, mention others, and more.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/text-editor/annotations.png"
    alt="Text editor annotations"
    width={1312}
    height={874}
  />

Add a floating Comments composer to your text editor using
[`FloatingComposer`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-lexical#FloatingComposer).

```tsx highlight="3"
<LexicalComposer initialConfig={initialConfig}>
  <LiveblocksPlugin>
    <FloatingComposer />
  </LiveblocksPlugin>
</LexicalComposer>
```

You can then create a button that
[opens the new annotation composer](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-lexical#Opening-the-FloatingComposer)
for the current selection with `OPEN_FLOATING_COMPOSER_COMMAND`.

```tsx
<button onClick={() => editor.dispatchCommand(OPEN_FLOATING_COMPOSER_COMMAND)}>
  ðŸ’¬ New comment
</button>
```

Add [`useThreads`](/docs/products/comments/hooks#threads-hook) to render your
comments to the page.

```tsx
import { useThreads } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";
import { Thread } from "@liveblocks/react-ui";

function Component() {
  const { threads } = useThreads();

  return (
    <>
      {threads.map((thread) => (
        <Thread key={thread.id} thread={thread} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Notifications

Add a [Notifications](/docs/products/notifications) UI to your application, and
automatically notify users when theyâ€™ve been mentioned. Notifications also
allows you to trigger sending emails, Slack, or any other kind of notification,
using our webhooks.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/text-editor/notifications.png"
    alt="Text editor notifications"
    width={1312}
    height={874}
  />
</Figure>

Notifications is enabled by default, which means you just need to add our UI
components to keep your users notified. Follow our
[get started guides](/docs/get-started/notifications) to learn how to set up
[`InboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#InboxNotification).

```tsx
export function CollaborativeApp() {
  const { inboxNotifications } = useInboxNotifications();

  return (
    <InboxNotificationList>
      {inboxNotifications.map((inboxNotification) => (
        <InboxNotification
          key={inboxNotification.id}
          inboxNotification={inboxNotification}
        />
      ))}
    </InboxNotificationList>
  );
}
```

Inline mentions also trigger
[`TextMention`](/docs/platform/webhooks#TextMention-notification) notification
webhook events. Learn more about
[sending email notifications](/docs/products/notifications/email-notifications).

## AI agents and editing on the server

Fetch and modify your text editorâ€™s content from the server, enabling features
such as AI agents. Easily make changes that update in real-time for every
connected user.

    src="/assets/text-editor/ai.png"
    alt="AI suggestions"
    width={1312}
    height={874}
  />
</Figure>

Use
[`withLexicalDocument`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node-lexical#withLexicalDocument)
to get your editorâ€™s content and make modifications live.

```tsx
await withLexicalDocument(
  { roomId: "my-room-id", client: liveblocks },
  async (doc) => {
    // Get editor content
    const textContent = doc.getTextContent();

    await doc.update(async () => {
      // Make real-time updates
      // ...
    });
  }
);
```
