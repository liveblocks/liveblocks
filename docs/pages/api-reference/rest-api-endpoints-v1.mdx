Manage a room and its storage using the Liveblocks REST API endpoints. They’ll
help you manage your data and extend Liveblocks’ functionality. You’ll find the
API base URL below.

```bash
https://liveblocks.net/api/v1/
```

This is the API v1 reference, learn more about the latest version on the [API v2
reference][].

## Authentication

To use the API, you need to add a JWT token to the request’s authorization
header:

```bash
curl https://liveblocks.net/api/v1/* \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

You can get a JWT token by calling our authorization endpoint, using your secret
key (accessible from the dashboard). The token will be valid for one hour.

```bash
curl https://liveblocks.io/api/authorize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

### Example response [@hidden]

```json
{ "token": "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" }
```

## Get room storage

Get the room storage data as a JSON using the endpoint below.

<EndpointBlock
  method="GET"
  endpoint="https://liveblocks.net/api/v1/room/:roomId/storage"
/>

### Some implementation details [@hidden]

- Each Liveblocks data structure is represented by a JSON element having two
  properties:
  - `"liveblocksType"`: [`"LiveObject"`][] | [`"LiveList"`][] | [`"LiveMap"`][]
  - `"data"` => contains the nested data structures (children) and data.
- The root is always a `LiveObject`.

### Example response [@hidden]

```json
{
  "liveblocksType": "LiveObject",
  "data": {
    "aLiveObject": {
      "liveblocksType": "LiveObject",
      "data": {
        "a": 1
      }
    },
    "aLiveList": {
      "liveblocksType": "LiveList",
      "data": ["a", "b"]
    },
    "aLiveMap": {
      "liveblocksType": "LiveMap",
      "data": {
        "a": 1,
        "b": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Initialize room storage

Initialize a room storage using the following endpoint. The storage of the room
you’re initializing must be empty. The new storage data can be passed as a JSON
in the request body.

<EndpointBlock
  method="POST"
  endpoint="https://liveblocks.net/api/v1/room/:roomId/storage"
/>

### Some implementation details [@hidden]

- The format of the request body is the same as what's returned by the get
  storage endpoint.
- For each Liveblocks data structure that you want to create, you need a JSON
  element having two properties:

  - `"liveblocksType"`: [`"LiveObject"`][] | [`"LiveList"`][] | [`"LiveMap"`][]
  - `"data"` => contains the nested data structures (children) and data.

- The root's type can only be `LiveObject`.

### Example request body [@hidden]

```json
{
  "liveblocksType": "LiveObject",
  "data": {
    "aLiveObject": {
      "liveblocksType": "LiveObject",
      "data": {
        "a": 1
      }
    },
    "aLiveList": {
      "liveblocksType": "LiveList",
      "data": ["a", "b"]
    },
    "aLiveMap": {
      "liveblocksType": "LiveMap",
      "data": {
        "a": 1,
        "b": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Delete room storage

Delete all elements of the room storage using the following endpoint.

<EndpointBlock
  method="DELETE"
  endpoint="https://liveblocks.net/api/v1/room/:roomId/storage"
/>

## Get room users

Get the current list of users connected to a room.

<EndpointBlock
  method="GET"
  endpoint="https://liveblocks.net/api/v1/room/:roomId/users"
/>

### Some implementation details [@hidden]

- User's custom properties `id` and `info` can be set during the authentication
  to the room, see [`authorize`][].

### Example response [@hidden]

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "user",
      "connectionId": 0,
      "id": "customUserId",
      "info": {}
    }
  ]
}
