`@liveblocks/node` provides you with Node.js APIs for
[authenticating Liveblocks users](#Liveblocks-client) and for
[implementing webhook handlers](#WebhookHandler). This library is only intended
for use in your Node.js back end.

## Liveblocks client [#Liveblocks-client]

The `Liveblocks` client is new in 1.2, and offers access to our REST API.

```ts showLineNumbers={false}
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});
```

### Authorization

To authorize your users with Liveblocks, you have the choice between two
different APIs.

- [`Liveblocks.prepareSession`](#access-tokens) is recommended for most
  applications.
- [`Liveblocks.identifyUser`](#id-tokens) is best if you’re using fine-grained
  permissions with our REST API.

#### Liveblocks.prepareSession [#access-tokens]

The purpose of this API is to help you implement your custom authentication back
end (i.e. the _server_ part of the diagram). You use the
`liveblocks.prepareSession()` API if you’d like to issue
[access tokens](/docs/rooms/permissions/access-token) from your back end.

<Banner title="What are access tokens?">
  Issuing access tokens is like issuing _hotel key cards_ from a hotel’s front
  desk (your back end). Any client with a key card can enter any room that the
  card gives access to. It’s easy to give out those key cards right from your
  back end.

    width={768}
    height={576}
  />
</Figure>

To implement your back end, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Create a `Session`</StepTitle>

    <StepContent>
      ```ts showLineNumbers={false}
      const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
        "marie@example.com",   // Required, user ID from your DB
        {
          // Optional, custom static metadata for the session
          userInfo: {
            name: "Marie",
            avatar: "https://example.com/avatar/marie.jpg",
          },
        }
      );
      ```

      The `userId` (required) is an identifier to uniquely identifies
      your user with Liveblocks. This value will be used when counting
      unique MAUs in your Liveblocks dashboard.

      The `userInfo` (optional) is any custom JSON value, which can be
      attached to static metadata to this user’s session. This will be
      publicly visible to all other people in the room. Useful for
      metadata like the user’s full name, or their avatar URL.

      </StepContent>

    </Step>

    <Step>
      <StepTitle>Decide which permissions to allow this session</StepTitle>
      <StepContent>
        ```ts showLineNumbers={false}
        session.allow("my-room-1", session.FULL_ACCESS);
        session.allow("my-room-2", session.FULL_ACCESS);
        session.allow("my-room-3", session.FULL_ACCESS);
        session.allow("my-team:*", session.READ_ACCESS);
        ```

        <Banner title="Be diligent" type="warning">
          You’re specifying what’s going to be allowed so be careful what
          permissions you’re giving your users. You’re responsible for this
          part.
        </Banner>
      </StepContent>
    </Step>

  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Authorize the session</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      Finally, authorize the session. This step makes the HTTP call to the
      Liveblocks servers. Liveblocks will return a signed **access token** that
      you can return to your client.

      ```ts showLineNumbers={false}
      // Requests the Liveblocks servers to authorize this session
      const { body, status } = await session.authorize();
      return new Response(body, { status });
      ```
    </StepContent>

    </Step>

</Steps>

##### Access tokens example [#access-token-example]

Here’s a real-world example of access tokens in a Next.js route
handler/endpoint. You can find examples for other frameworks in our
[authentication section](/docs/rooms/authentication/access-token-permissions).

```ts file="route.ts"
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */

  // Get the current user from your database
  const user = __getUserFromDB__(request);

  // Start an auth session inside your endpoint
  const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
    user.id,
    { userInfo: user.metadata } // Optional
  );

  // Implement your own security, and give the user access to the room
  const { room } = await request.json();
  if (room && __shouldUserHaveAccess__(user, room)) {
    session.allow(room, session.FULL_ACCESS);
  }

  // Retrieve a token from the Liveblocks servers and pass it to the
  // requesting client
  const { body, status } = await session.authorize();
  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

#### Liveblocks.identifyUser [#id-tokens]

The purpose of this API is to help you implement your custom authentication back
end (i.e. the _server_ part of the diagram). You use the
`liveblocks.identifyUser()` API if you’d like to issue
[ID tokens](/docs/rooms/permissions/id-token) from your back end. An ID token
does not grant any permissions in the token directly. Instead, it only securely
identifies your user, and then uses any permissions set via the [Permissions
REST API][] to decide whether to allow the user on a room-by-room basis.

Use this approach if you’d like Liveblocks to be the source of truth for your
user’s permissions.

<Banner title="What are ID tokens?">
  Issuing identity tokens is like issuing _membership cards_. Anyone with a
  membership card can try to enter a room, but your permissions will be checked
  at the door. The Liveblocks servers perform this authorization, so your
  permissions need to be set up front using the Liveblocks REST API.
</Banner>

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/id-token-auth-diagram.png"
    alt="Auth diagram"
    width={768}
    height={576}
  />
</Figure>

Implement your back end endpoint as follows:

```ts showLineNumbers={false}
const { body, status } = await liveblocks.identifyUser(
  {
    userId: "marie@example.com", // Required, user ID from your DB
    groupIds: ["marketing", "engineering"],
  },

  // Optional
  {
    userInfo: {
      name: "Marie",
      avatar: "https://example.com/avatar/marie.jpg",
    },
  }
);

return new Response(body, { status });
```

`userId` (required) is a string identifier to uniquely identify your user with
Liveblocks. This value will be used when counting unique MAUs in your Liveblocks
dashboard. You can refer to these user IDs in the [Permissions REST API][] when
assigning group permissions.

`groupIds` (optional) can be used to specify which groups this user belongs to.
These are arbitrary identifiers that make sense to your app, and that you can
refer to in the [Permissions REST API][] when assigning group permissions.

`userInfo` (optional) is any custom JSON value, which you can use to attach
static metadata to this user’s session. This will be publicly visible to all
other people in the room. Useful for metadata like the user’s full name, or
their avatar URL.

##### ID tokens example

Here’s a real-world example of ID tokens in a Next.js route handler/endpoint.
You can find examples for other frameworks in our
[authentication section](/docs/rooms/authentication/id-token-permissions).

```ts file="Next.js"
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export default async function auth(req, res) {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */

  // Get the current user from your database
  const user = __getUserFromDB__(req);

  // Create an ID token for the user
  const { body, status } = await liveblocks.identifyUser(
    {
      userId: user.id,
    },
    {
      userInfo: {
        name: user.fullName,
        color: user.favoriteColor,
      },
    }
  );

  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

### Room

#### Liveblocks.getRooms [#get-rooms]

Returns a list of rooms that are in the current project. The project is
determined by the secret key you’re using. Rooms are sorted by creation time,
with the newest room at index `0`. This is a wrapper around the
[Get Rooms API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms) and returns
the same response.

```ts
const { data: rooms, nextPage } = await liveblocks.getRooms();

// A list of rooms
// [{ type: "room", id: "my-room-id", ... }, ...]
console.log(rooms);

// A pagination value used for retrieving the next page of results
// "L3YyL3Jvb21z..."
console.log(nextPage);
```

A number of options are also available, enabling you to filter for certain
rooms.

```ts
const { data: rooms, nextPage } = await liveblocks.getRooms({
  // Optional, the amount of rooms to load, between 1 and 100, defaults to 20
  limit: 20,

  // Optional, filter for rooms that allow entry to group ID(s) in `groupAccesses`
  groupIds: ["engineering", "design"],

  // Optional, filter for rooms that allow entry to a user's ID in `usersAccesses`
  userId: "my-user-id",

  // Optional, filter for rooms with custom metadata in `metadata`
  metadata: {
    myRoomType: "whiteboard",
  },

  // Optional, cursor used for pagination, use `nextPage` from the previous page's response
  startingAfter: "L3YyL3Jvb21z...",
});
```

You can use `nextPage` to paginate rooms. In this example, when `getNextPage` is
called, the next set of rooms is added to `pages`.

```ts
import { RoomInfo } from "@liveblocks/node";

// An array of pages, each containing a list of retrieved rooms
const pages: RoomInfo[][] = [];

// Holds the pagination cursor for the next set of rooms
let startingAfter;

// Call to get the next page of rooms
async function getNextPage() {
  const { data, nextPage } = await liveblocks.getRooms({ startingAfter });
  pages.push(data);
  startingAfter = nextPage;
}
```

#### Liveblocks.createRoom [#post-rooms]

Programmatically creates a new room from a room ID. The `defaultAccesses` option
is required. Setting `defaultAccesses` to `["room:write"]` creates a public
room, whereas setting it to `[]` will create a private room that needs
[ID token permission to enter](/docs/rooms/permissions/id-token). This is a
wrapper around the
[Create Room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms) and returns
the same response.

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("my-room-id", {
  defaultAccesses: ["room:write"],
});

// { type: "room", id: "my-room-id", ... }
console.log(room);
```

A number of room creation options are available, allowing you to set permissions
and attach custom metadata.

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("my-room-id", {
  // The default room permissions. `[]` for private, `["room:write"]` for public.
  defaultAccesses: [],

  // Optional, the room's group ID permissions
  groupAccesses: {
    design: ["room:write"],
    engineering: ["room:presence:write", "room:read"],
  },

  // Optional, the room's user ID permissions
  userAccesses: {
    "my-user-id": ["room:write"],
  },

  // Optional, custom metadata to attach to the room
  metadata: {
    myRoomType: "whiteboard",
  },
});
```

Group and user permissions are only used with
[ID token authorization](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#id-tokens), learn
more about
[managing permission with ID tokens](/docs/rooms/permissions/id-token).

#### Liveblocks.getRoom [#get-rooms-roomId]

Returns a room. Throws an error if the room isn’t found. This is a wrapper
around the
[Get Room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId) and
returns the same response.

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.getRoom("my-room-id");

// { type: "room", id: "my-room-id", ... }
console.log(room);
```

#### Liveblocks.updateRoom [#post-rooms-roomId]

Updates properties on a room. Throws an error if the room isn’t found. This is a
wrapper around the
[Update Room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId) and
returns the same response.

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("my-room-id", {
  // The metadata or permissions you're updating
  // ...
});

// { type: "room", id: "my-room-id", ... }
console.log(room);
```

Permissions and metadata properties can be updated on the room. Note that you
need only pass the properties you’re updating. Setting a property to `null` will
delete the property.

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("my-room-id", {
  // Optional, update the default room permissions. `[]` for private, `["room:write"]` for public.
  defaultAccesses: [],

  // Optional, update the room's group ID permissions
  groupAccesses: {
    design: ["room:write"],
    engineering: ["room:presence:write", "room:read"],
  },

  // Optional, update the room's user ID permissions
  userAccesses: {
    "my-user-id": ["room:write"],
  },

  // Optional, custom metadata to update on the room
  metadata: {
    myRoomType: "whiteboard",
  },
});
```

Group and user permissions are only used with
[ID token authorization](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#id-tokens), learn
more about
[managing permission with ID tokens](/docs/rooms/permissions/id-token).

#### Liveblocks.deleteRoom [#delete-rooms-roomId]

Deletes a room. Throws an error if the room isn’t found. This is a wrapper
around the
[Delete Room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-rooms-roomId)
and returns no response.

```ts
await liveblocks.deleteRoom("my-room-id");
```

#### Liveblocks.getActiveUsers [#get-rooms-roomId-active-users]

Returns a list of users that are currently present in the room. Throws an error
if the room isn’t found. This is a wrapper around the
[Get Active Users API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-active-users)
and returns the same response.

```ts
const activeUsers = await liveblocks.getActiveUsers("my-room-id");

// { data: [{ type: "user", id: "my-user-id", ... }, ...] }
console.log(activeUsers);
```

Using `UserMeta["info"]` from your config file as a generic adds typing to the
returned `activeUsers`.

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="5-8"
// ...

export type UserMeta = {
  id: string;
  info: {
    name: string;
    avatar: string;
  };
};
```

```ts highlight="4"
import { UserMeta } from "../liveblocks.config";

const activeUsers =
  await liveblocks.getActiveUsers<UserMeta["info"]>("my-room-id");

// { data: [{ ..., info: { name: "Nimesh", avatar: "https://..." }, ...] }
console.log(activeUsers);
```

#### Liveblocks.broadcastEvent [#post-broadcast-event]

Broadcasts a custom event to the room. Throws an error if the room isn’t found.
This is a wrapper around the
[Broadcast Event API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-broadcast-event)
and returns no response.

```ts
const customEvent = {
  type: "EMOJI",
  emoji: "🔥",
};

await liveblocks.broadcastEvent("my-room-id", customEvent);
```

You can respond to custom events on the front end with
[`useBroadcastEvent`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useBroadcastEvent)
and
[`room.subscribe("event")`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Room.subscribe.event).
When receiving an event sent with `Liveblocks.broadcastEvent`, `user` will be
`null` and `connectionId` will be `-1`.

```tsx
import { useEventListener } from "./liveblocks.config";

// When receiving an event sent from `@liveblocks/node`
useEventListener(({ event, user, connectionId }) => {
  // `null`
  console.log(user);

  // `-1`
  console.log(connectionId);
});
```

### Storage

#### Liveblocks.getStorageDocument [#get-rooms-roomId-storage]

Returns the contents of a room’s Storage tree. By default, returns Storage in
LSON format. Throws an error if the room isn’t found. This is a wrapper around
the
[Get Storage Document API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-storage)
and returns the same response.

```ts
const storage = await liveblocks.getStorageDocument("my-room-id");
```

LSON is a custom Liveblocks format that preserves information about the
conflict-free data types used. By default, `getStorageDocument` returns Storage
in this format. This is the same as using `"plain-json"` in the second argument.

```ts highlight="2"
// Retrieve LSON Storage data
const storage = await liveblocks.getStorageDocument("my-room-id", "plain-lson");

// If this were your Storage type...
type Storage = {
  names: LiveList<string>;
};

// {
//   liveblocksType: "LiveObject",
//   data: {
//     names: {
//       liveblocksType: "LiveList",
//       data: ["Olivier", "Nimesh"],
//     }
//   }
// }
console.log(storage);
```

You can also retrieve Storage as JSON by passing `"json"` into the second
argument.

```ts highlight="2"
// Retrieve JSON Storage data
const storage = await liveblocks.getStorageDocument("my-room-id", "json");

// If this were your Storage type...
type Storage = {
  names: LiveList<string>;
};

// {
//   names: ["Olivier", "Nimesh"]
// }
console.log(storage);
```

#### Liveblocks.initializeStorageDocument [#post-rooms-roomId-storage]

Initializes a room’s Storage tree with given LSON data. To use this, the room
must have [already been created](#post-rooms) and have empty Storage. Throws an
error if the room isn’t found. Calling this will disconnect all active users
from the room. This is a wrapper around the
[Initialize Storage Document API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId-storage)
and returns the same response.

```ts
// Create a new room
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("my-room-id", {
  defaultAccesses: ["room:write"],
});

// Initialize Storage
const storage = await liveblocks.initializeStorageDocument("my-room-id", {
  // Your LSON Storage value
  // ...
});
```

LSON is a custom Liveblocks format that preserves information about
conflict-free data types. Here’s an example of initializing a simple Storage
value.

```ts highlight="7-9,13-19"
// Create a new room
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("my-room-id", {
  defaultAccesses: ["room:write"],
});

// If this were your Storage type...
type Storage = {
  names: LiveList<string>;
};

// Create this Storage and add names to the LiveList
const storage = await liveblocks.initializeStorageDocument("my-room-id", {
  liveblocksType: "LiveObject",
  data: {
    names: {
      liveblocksType: "LiveList",
      data: ["Olivier", "Nimesh"],
    },
  },
});
```

Using the `toPlainLson` helper provided by `@liveblocks/client`, you can more
easily create LSON.

```ts highlight="1,14-16,21"
import { toPlainLson, LiveList, LiveObject } from "@liveblocks/client";

// Create a new room
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("my-room-id", {
  defaultAccesses: ["room:write"],
});

// If this were your Storage type...
type Storage = {
  names: LiveList<string>;
};

// Create the initial conflict-free data
const initialStorage: LiveObject<Storage> = new LiveObject({
  names: new LiveList[("Olivier", "Nimesh")](),
});

// Convert to LSON and create Storage
const storage = await liveblocks.initializeStorageDocument(
  "my-room-id",
  toPlainLson(initialStorage)
);
```

#### Liveblocks.deleteStorageDocument [#delete-rooms-roomId-storage]

Deletes a room’s Storage data. Calling this will disconnect all active users
from the room. Throws an error if the room isn’t found. This is a wrapper around
the
[Delete Storage Document API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-rooms-roomId-storage)
and returns no response.

```ts
await liveblocks.deleteStorageDocument("my-room-id");
```

### Yjs

#### Liveblocks.getYjsDocument [#get-rooms-roomId-ydoc]

Returns a JSON representation of a room’s Yjs document. Throws an error if the
room isn’t found. This is a wrapper around the
[Get Yjs Document API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-ydoc)
and returns the same response.

```ts
const yjsDocument = await liveblocks.getYjsDocument("my-room-id");

// { yourYText: "...", yourYArray: [...], ... }
console.log(yjsDocument);
```

A number of options are available.

```ts
const yjsDocument = await liveblocks.getYjsDocument("my-room-id", {
  // Optional, if true, `yText` values will return formatting
  formatting: true,

  // Optional, return a single key's value, e.g. `yDoc.get("my-key-id").toJson()`
  key: "my-key-id",

  // Optional, override the inferred `key` type, e.g. "ymap" for `doc.get(key, Y.Map)`
  type: "ymap",
});
```

#### Liveblocks.sendYjsBinaryUpdate [#put-rooms-roomId-ydoc]

Send a Yjs binary update to a room’s Yjs document. You can use this to update or
initialize the room’s Yjs document. Throws an error if the room isn’t found.
This is a wrapper around the
[Send a Binary Yjs Update API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#put-rooms-roomId-ydoc)
and returns no response.

```ts
await liveblocks.sendYjsBinaryUpdate("my-room-id", {
  // Your yDoc in binary update format
  update: Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(yDoc),
});
```

Here’s an example of how to update a room’s Yjs document with your changes.

```ts
import * as Y from "yjs";

// Create a Yjs document
const yDoc = new Y.Doc();

// Create your data structures and make your update
const yText = yDoc.getText("text");
yText.insert(0, "Hello world");

// Encode your yDoc state as a binary update message and send to Liveblocks
await liveblocks.sendYjsBinaryUpdate("my-room-id", {
  update: Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(yDoc),
});
```

To create a new room and initialize its Yjs document, call
[`liveblocks.createRoom`](#post-rooms) before sending the binary update.

```ts highlight="1-2"
// Create new room
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("my-room-id");

// Set initial Yjs document value
await liveblocks.sendYjsBinaryUpdate("my-room-id", {
  update: Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(yDoc),
});
```

Note that each text and code editor handles binary updates in a different way.
For example, this is how to create a binary update with
[Slate](https://www.slatejs.org/).

```ts title="Slate binary update" highlight="3,13-17,19-21" isCollapsed isCollapsable
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";
import * as Y from "yjs";
import { slateNodesToInsertDelta } from "@slate-yjs/core";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST() {
  // Create a Yjs document
  const yDoc = new Y.Doc();

  // Create Slate document state
  const slateDoc = {
    type: "paragraph",
    children: [{ text: "Hello world" }],
  };

  // Create your data structures and make your update
  const insertDelta = slateNodesToInsertDelta(slateDoc);
  (yDoc.get("content", Y.XmlText) as Y.XmlText).applyDelta(insertDelta);

  // Update Yjs document value
  await liveblocks.sendYjsBinaryUpdate("my-room-id", {
    update: Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(yDoc),
  });
}
```

Read the [Yjs documentation](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/document-updates) to learn
more about creating binary updates.

#### Liveblocks.getYjsDocumentAsBinaryUpdate [#get-rooms-roomId-ydoc-binary]

Return a room’s Yjs document as a single binary update. You can use this to get
a copy of your Yjs document in your back end. Throws an error if the room isn’t
found. This is a wrapper around the
[Get Yjs Document Encoded as a Binary Yjs Update API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-ydoc-binary)
and returns the same response.

```ts
const binaryYjsUpdate =
  await liveblocks.getYjsDocumentAsBinaryUpdate("my-room-id");
```

Read the [Yjs documentation](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/document-updates) to learn
more about using binary updates.

### Schema validation

#### Liveblocks.createSchema [#post-create-new-schema]

Creates a schema that can be used to enforce a room’s Storage data structure.
The schema consists of a unique name, and a body which specifies the data shape
of the room in Liveblocks
[schema syntax](/docs/platform/schema-validation/syntax). This is a wrapper
around the
[Create Schema API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-create-new-schema)
and returns the same response.

```ts
const schemaBody = `
  type Storage {
    names: LiveList<string>
  }
`;

const schema = await liveblocks.createSchema("my-schema-name", schemaBody);

// { id: "my-schema-name@1", name: "my-schema-name", version: 1, ... }
console.log(schema);
```

Read the [schema validation](/docs/platform/schema-validation) page to learn
more.

#### Liveblocks.getSchema [#get-create-new-schema]

Returns a schema from its ID. A schema’s ID is a combination of its name and
version, for example the ID for version `1` of `my-schema-name` is
`my-schema-name@1`. This is a wrapper around the
[Get Schema API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-create-new-schema)
and returns the same response.

```ts

the data shape of the room in Liveblocks
[schema syntax](/docs/platform/schema-validation/syntax). Find the schema by its
ID, a combination of its name and version, for example the ID for version `1` of
`my-schema-name` is `my-schema-name@1`. This is a wrapper around the
[Update Schema API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#put-update-new-schema)
and returns the same response.

```ts
const schema = await liveblocks.updateSchema("my-schema-name@1");

// { id: "my-schema-name@1", name: "my-schema-name", version: 1, ... }
console.log(schema);
```

#### Liveblocks.attachSchemaToRoom [#post-attach-schema-to-room]

Attaches a schema to a room, and instantly enables runtime schema validation in
it. Attach the schema by its ID, a combination of its name and version, for
example the ID for version `1` of `my-schema-name` is `my-schema-name@1`. This
is a wrapper around the
[Attach Schema to a Room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-attach-schema-to-room)
and returns the same response.

If the current contents of the room’s Storage do not match the schema, attaching
will fail and the error message will give details on why the schema failed to
attach. It’ll also throw an error if the room isn’t found.

```ts
const schema = await liveblocks.attachSchemaToRoom(
  "my-room-id",
  "my-schema-name@1"
);

// { id: "my-schema-name@1", name: "my-schema-name", version: 1, ... }

### Error handling [#error-handling]

Errors in our API methods, such as network failures, invalid arguments, or
server-side issues, are reported through the `LiveblocksError` class. This
custom error class extends the standard JavaScript
[`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)
and includes a `status` property, which provides the HTTP status code for the
error, such as 404 for not found or 500 for server errors.

Example of handling errors in a typical API call:

```ts
try {
  const room = await liveblocks.getRoom("my-room-id");
  // Process room
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof LiveblocksError) {
    // Handle specific LiveblocksError cases
    console.error(`Error fetching room: ${error.status} - ${error.message}`);
    switch (
      error.status
      // Specific cases based on status codes
    ) {
    }
  } else {
    // Handle general errors
    console.error(`Unexpected error: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

## Utilities

### getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody [#get-mentioned-ids-from-comment-body]

Returns an array of each user’s ID that has been mentioned in a `CommentBody`
(found under `comment.body`).

```ts
import { getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody } from "@liveblocks/node";

const mentionedIds = getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody(comment.body);
```

This is most commonly used in combination with the
[Comments API functions](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#Comments), for
example [`getComment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-comment).

```ts
import { Liveblocks, getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Create a node client
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

// Retrieve a comment
const comment = await liveblocks.getComment({
  roomId: "my-room-id",
  threadId: "my-thread-id",
  commentId: "my-comment-id",
});

// Get the mentions inside the comment's body
const mentionedIds = getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody(comment.body);

// ["marc@example.com", "vincent@example.com", ...]
console.log(mentionedIds);
```

Here’s an example with a custom `CommentBody`.

```ts
import { CommentBody, getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Create a custom `CommentBody`
const commentBody: CommentBody = {
  version: 1,
  content: [
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      children: [
        { text: "Hello " },
        { type: "mention", id: "chris@example.com" },
      ],
    },
  ],
};

// Get the mentions inside the comment's body
const mentionedIds = getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody(commentBody);

// ["chris@example.com"]
console.log(mentionedIds);
```

### stringifyCommentBody [#stringify-comment-body]

Used to convert a `CommentBody` (found under `comment.body`) into either a plain
string, Markdown, HTML, or a custom format.

```ts
import { stringifyCommentBody } from "@liveblocks/node";

const stringComment = await stringifyCommentBody(comment.body);
```

This is most commonly used in combination with the
[Comments API functions](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#Comments), for
example [`getComment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-comment).

```ts
import { Liveblocks, stringifyCommentBody } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Create a node client
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

// Retrieve a comment
const comment = await liveblocks.getComment({
  roomId: "my-room-id",
  threadId: "my-thread-id",
  commentId: "my-comment-id",
});

// Convert CommentBody to plain string
const stringComment = await stringifyCommentBody(comment.body);

// "Hello marc@example.com from https://liveblocks.io"
console.log(stringComment);
```

A number of options are also available.

```ts
import { stringifyCommentBody } from "@liveblocks/node";

const stringComment = await stringifyCommentBody(comment.body, {
  // Optional, convert to specific format, "plain" (default) | "markdown" | "html"
  format: "markdown",

  // Optional, supply a separator to be used between paragraphs
  separator: `\n\n`,

  // Optional, override any elements in the CommentBody with a custom string
  elements: {
    // Optional, override the `paragraph` element
    paragraph: ({ element, children }) => `<p>${children}</p>`,

    // Optional, override the `text` element
    text: ({ element }) =>
      element.bold ? `<strong>${element.text}</strong>` : `${element.text}`,

    // Optional, override the `link` element
    link: ({ element, href }) =>
      `<a href="${href}" target="_blank">${element.url}</a>`,

    // Optional, override the `mention` element. `user` available if `resolveUsers` supplied
    mention: ({ element, user }) =>
      `<a href="${user.profileUrl}">${element.id}</a>`,
  },

  // Optional, get your user's names and info from their ID to be displayed in mentions
  async resolveUsers({ userIds }) {
    const usersData = await __getUsersFromDB__(userIds);

    return usersData.map((userData) => ({
      // Name is inserted into the output instead of a user's ID
      name: userData.name,

      // Custom formatting in `elements.mention` allows custom properties to be used
      profileUrl: userData.profileUrl,
    }));
  },
});

`CommentBody`.

```ts
// "Hello marc@example.com from https://liveblocks.io"
await stringifyCommentBody(comment.body);

// "Hello @Marc from https://liveblocks.io"
await stringifyCommentBody(comment.body, {
  resolveUser({ userIds }) {
    return [{ name: "Marc" }];
  },
});

// "**Hello** @Marc from [https://liveblocks.io](https://liveblocks.io)"
await stringifyCommentBody(comment.body, {
  format: "markdown",

  resolveUser() {
    return [{ name: "Marc" }];
  },
});

// "<b>Hello</b> <span data-mention>@Marc</span> from
// <a href="https://liveblocks.io">https://liveblocks.io</a>"
await stringifyCommentBody(comment.body, {
  format: "html",

  resolveUser() {
    return [{ name: "Marc" }];
  },
});

// "<b>Hello</b> <a href="https://example.com" data-id="marc@example.com">@Marc</a> from
// <a href="https://liveblocks.io">https://liveblocks.io</a>"
await stringifyCommentBody(comment.body, {
  format: "html",

  mention: ({ element, user }) =>
    `<a href="${user.profileUrl}" data-id="${element.id}">${user.name}</a>`,

  resolveUser() {
    return [{ name: "Marc", profileUrl: "https://example.com" }];
  },
});
```

### WebhookHandler [#WebhookHandler]

<Banner title="Need help implementing webhooks?">

Read the [Webhooks guide](/docs/platform/webhooks) to learn how to use them
within your product, allowing you to react to Liveblocks events as they happen.

</Banner>

The `WebhookHandler` class is a helper to handle webhook requests from
Liveblocks.

It’s initialized with a signing secret that you can find in your project’s
webhook page.

```js
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET);
```

#### verifyRequest [#verifyRequest]

Verifies the request and returns the event. Note that `rawBody` takes the body
as a `string`.

```js
const event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
  headers: req.headers,
  rawBody: req.body,
});
```

Some frameworks parse request bodies into objects, which means using
`JSON.stringify` may be necessary.

```js highlight="3"
const event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
  headers: req.headers,
  rawBody: JSON.stringify(req.body),
});
```

##### Example using Next.js [#webhook-example]

```js
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Will fail if not properly initialized with a secret
// Obtained from the Webhooks section of your project dashboard
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export function POST(request) {
  try {
    const event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: req.headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(req.body),
    });

    // Handle `WebhookEvent`

    if (event.type === "storageUpdated") {
      // Handle `StorageUpdatedEvent`
    } else if (event.type === "userEntered") {
      // Handle `UserEnteredEvent`
    } else if (event.type === "userLeft") {
      // Handle `UserLeftEvent`
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return new Response(error, { status: 400 });
  }
}
```

### authorize (deprecated) [#authorize]

<Banner title="Deprecated" type="error">
  For now, it’s still supported, but this way of authorizing will eventually get
  deprecated.
</Banner>

The purpose of `authorize()` was to help you implement your custom
authentication back end. It generates old-style single-room tokens.

Please refer to [our upgrade guide](/docs/platform/upgrading/1.2) if you're
using the `authorize` function in your back end. You should adopt
[`Liveblocks.prepareSession`](#access-tokens) or
[`Liveblocks.identifyUser`](#id-tokens) APIs instead.
