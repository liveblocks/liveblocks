`@liveblocks/react` provides you with [React](https://react.dev/) bindings for
our real-time collaboration APIs, built on top of WebSockets. Read our
[getting started](/docs/get-started) guides to learn more.

## Room

### createRoomContext

Creates a [`RoomProvider`][] and a set of typed hooks. We recommend using it in
`liveblocks.config.ts` and re-exporting your typed hooks like below.

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { createRoomContext } from "@liveblocks/react";

const client = createClient({
  /* client options */
});

// Presence represents the properties that will exist on every User in the Room
// and that will automatically be kept in sync. Accessible through the
// `user.presence` property. Must be JSON-serializable.
type Presence = {
  // cursor: { x: number, y: number } | null,
  // ...
};

// Optionally, Storage represents the shared document that persists in the
// Room, even after all Users leave. Fields under Storage typically are
// LiveList, LiveMap, LiveObject instances, for which updates are
// automatically persisted and synced to all connected clients.
type Storage = {
  // animals: LiveList<string>,
  // ...
};

// Optionally, UserMeta represents static/readonly metadata on each User, as
// provided by your own custom auth backend (if used). Useful for data that
// will not change during a session, like a User's name or avatar.
// type UserMeta = {
//   id?: string,  // Accessible through `user.id`
//   info?: Json,  // Accessible through `user.info`
// };

// Optionally, the type of custom events broadcasted and listened for in this
// room. Must be JSON-serializable.
// type RoomEvent = {};

// Optionally, ThreadMetadata represents metadata on each thread.
// Must only contain scalar values.
// type ThreadMetadata = {
//   resolved?: boolean;
// };

export const {
  RoomProvider,
  useMyPresence,
  useObject,
  /* ...all the other hooks you’re using... */
} = createRoomContext<
  Presence,
  Storage
  /* UserMeta, RoomEvent, ThreadMetadata */
>(client);
```

#### resolveUser

<Banner title="Private beta">

Comments is currently in private beta.
[Sign up for the waitlist](https://forms.gle/xgp54aTMsoH8hrjU9) to get access in
the near future.

</Banner>

When using [Comments](/docs/products/comments), anything that is linked to a
user (comments, mentions, etc.) will reference their ID. To display user
information based on IDs, you can provide a resolver function to the
`resolveUser` option in [`createRoomContext`](#createRoomContext).

This resolver function will receive a user ID and should return a user object
asynchronously.

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts"
// ...

export const {
  /* ... */
} = createRoomContext(client, {
  resolveUser: async ({ userId }) => {
    const userData = __getUserFromDB__(userId);

    return {
      name: userData.name,
      avatar: userData.avatar.src,
    };
  },
});
```

<Banner title="User object">
  The user object returned by the resolver function takes the shape of
  `UserMeta["info"]`, which contains `name` and `avatar` (both optional) by
  default. If you provided your own `UserMeta` type to `createRoomContext`, your
  own `UserMeta["info"]` will be required here as well. But keep in mind that
  the [default
  components](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments#Components) will
  look specifically for the `name` and `avatar` properties to display user names
  and avatars. If you use the
  [primitives](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments#Primitives)
  instead, you’ll be able to use [`useUser`](#useUser) and decide what
  properties to use within your custom components.
</Banner>

Once that’s done, components will show user names and avatars accordingly.

#### resolveMentionSuggestions

<Banner title="Private beta">

Comments is currently in private beta.
[Sign up for the waitlist](https://forms.gle/xgp54aTMsoH8hrjU9) to get access in
the near future.

</Banner>

To enable creating mentions in [Comments](/docs/products/comments), you can
provide a resolver function to the `resolveMentionSuggestions` option in
[`createRoomContext`](#createRoomContext).

This resolver function will receive the mention currently being written (e.g.
when writing “@jane”, `text` will be `jane`) and should return a list of user
IDs matching that text. This function will be called every time the text changes
but with some debouncing.

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts"
// ...

export const {
  /* ... */
} = createRoomContext(client, {
  resolveMentionSuggestions: ({ text, roomId }) => {
    const workspaceUsers = __getWorkspaceUsersFromDB__(roomId);

    if (!text) {
      // Show all workspace users by default

      return __getUserIds__(workspaceUsers);
    } else {
      const matchingUsers = __findUsers__(workspaceUsers, text);

      return __getUserIds__(matchingUsers);
    }
  },
});
```

### RoomProvider

Makes a [`Room`] available in the component hierarchy below. When this component
is unmounted, the current user leaves the room. That means that you can’t use
two RoomProviders with the same room ID in your React tree.

- `initialPresence` - The initial Presence to use for the User currently
  entering the Room. Presence data belongs to the current User and is readable
  to all other Users in the room while the current User is connected to the
  Room. Must be serializable to JSON.
- `initialStorage` (optional) - The initial Storage structure to create when a
  new Room is entered for the first time. Storage data is shared and belongs to
  the Room itself. It persists even after all Users leave the room, and is
  mutable by every client. Must either contain Live structures (e.g.
  `new LiveList()`, `new LiveObject({ a: 1 })`, etc.) or be serializable to
  JSON.
- `shouldInitiallyConnect` (optional) - Whether or not the room should connect
  to Liveblocks servers when the RoomProvider is rendered. By default equals to
  `typeof window !== "undefined"`, meaning the RoomProvider tries to connect to
  Liveblocks servers only on the client side.

The `initialPresence`, `initialStorage` and `shouldInitiallyConnect` props are
ignored after the first render, so changes to the initial value argument won’t
have an observable effect.

```tsx
import { LiveList, LiveMap, LiveObject } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";

function AppRoot() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider
      id="my-room"
      // 😎 Replace with your own data!
      initialPresence={{ cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } }}
      // 😎 Replace with your own data!
      initialStorage={() => ({
        animals: new LiveList(["🦁", "🦊", "🐵"]),

        mathematician: new LiveObject({
          firstName: "Ada",
          lastName: "Lovelace",
        }),

        fruitsByName: new LiveMap([
          ["apple", "🍎"],
          ["banana", "🍌"],
          ["cherry", "🍒"],
        ]),
      })}
    >
      {/* children */}
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

### useRoom

Returns the [`Room`][] of the nearest [`RoomProvider`][] above in the React
component tree.

```ts
import { useRoom } from "./liveblocks.config";

const room = useRoom();
```

### useErrorListener

Listen to potential room connection errors.

```ts
import { useErrorListener } from "./liveblocks.config";

useErrorListener((error) => {
  switch (error.code) {
    case -1:
      // Authentication error
      break;

    case 4001:
      // Could not connect because you don't have access to this room
      break;

    case 4005:
      // Could not connect because room was full
      break;

    default:
      // Unexpected error
      break;
  }
});
```

### useStatus

Returns the current WebSocket connection status of the room, and will re-render
your component whenever it changes.

```ts
import { useStatus } from "./liveblocks.config";

const status = useStatus();
```

The possible value are: `initial`, `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, or
`disconnected`.

### useLostConnectionListener

Calls the given callback in the exceptional situation that a connection is lost
and reconnecting does not happen quickly enough.

This event allows you to build high-quality UIs by warning your users that the
app is still trying to re-establish the connection, for example through a toast
notification. You may want to take extra care in the mean time to ensure their
changes won’t go unsaved.

When this happens, this callback is called with the event `lost`. Then, once the
connection restores, the callback will be called with the value `restored`. If
the connection could definitively not be restored, it will be called with
`failed` (uncommon).

The [`lostConnectionTimeout`][] client option will determine how quickly this
event will fire after a connection loss (default: 5 seconds).

```ts
import { toast } from "my-preferred-toast-library";

function App() {
  useLostConnectionListener((event) => {
    switch (event) {
      case "lost":
        toast.warn("Still trying to reconnect...");
        break;

      case "restored":
        toast.success("Successfully reconnected again!");
        break;

      case "failed":
        toast.error("Could not restore the connection");
        break;
    }
  });
}
```

Automatically unsubscribes when the component is unmounted.

For a demonstration of this behavior, see our [connection status example][].

## Presence

<Banner title="Need help troubleshooting presence?">

Try the [Liveblocks DevTools extension](/devtools) to visualize your
collaborative experiences as you build them, in real-time.

</Banner>

### useMyPresence

Return the presence of the current user, and a function to update it.
Automatically subscribes to updates to the current user’s presence.

Note that the `updateMyPresence` setter function is different to the setter
function returned by React’s `useState` hook. Instead, you can pass a partial
presence object to `updateMyPresence`, and any changes will be merged into the
current presence. It will not replace the entire presence object.

```ts
import { useMyPresence } from "./liveblocks.config";

const [myPresence, updateMyPresence] = useMyPresence();
updateMyPresence({ x: 0 });
updateMyPresence({ y: 0 });

// At the next render, "myPresence" will be equal to "{ x: 0, y: 0 }"
```

This is roughly equal to:

```tsx
const myPresence = useSelf((me) => me.presence);
const updateMyPresence = useUpdateMyPresence();
```

### useUpdateMyPresence

Returns a setter function to update the current user’s presence.

Use this if you don’t need the current user’s presence in your component, but
you need to update it (e.g. live cursor). It’s better to use
`useUpdateMyPresence` because it won’t subscribe your component to get
rerendered when the presence updates.

Note that the `updateMyPresence` setter function is different to the setter
function returned by React’s `useState` hook. Instead, you can pass a partial
presence object to `updateMyPresence`, and any changes will be merged into the
current presence. It will not replace the entire presence object.

```ts
import { useUpdateMyPresence } from "./liveblocks.config";

const updateMyPresence = useUpdateMyPresence();

updateMyPresence({ y: 0 });
```

### useSelf

Returns the current user once it is connected to the room, and automatically
subscribes to updates to the current user.

```ts
import { useSelf } from "./liveblocks.config";

const currentUser = useSelf();
// {
//   connectionId: 1,
//   presence: { cursor: { x: 27, y: -8 } },
// }

const currentUser = useSelf((me) => me.presence.cursor);
// { x: 27, y: -8 }
```

The benefit of using a selector is that it will only update your component if
that particular selection changes. For full details, see [how selectors work][].

👉 A [Suspense version][] of this hook is also available, which will never
return `null`.

### useOthers

Extracts data from the list of other users currently in the same Room, and
automatically subscribes to updates on the selected data. For full details, see
[how selectors work][].

The `others` argument to the `useOthers` selector function is an _immutable_
array of Users.

```tsx
// ✅ Rerenders only if the number of users changes
const numOthers = useOthers((others) => others.length);

// ✅ Rerenders only if someone starts or stops typing
const isSomeoneTyping = useOthers((others) =>
  others.some((other) => other.presence.isTyping)
);

// ✅ Rerenders only if actively typing users are updated
const typingUsers = useOthers(
  (others) => others.filter((other) => other.presence.isTyping),
  shallow // 👈
);
```

👉 A [Suspense version][] of this hook is also available, which will never
return `null`.

One caveat with this API is that selecting a subset of data for each user
quickly becomes tricky. When you want to select and get updates for only a
particular subset of each user’s data, we recommend using the
[`useOthersMapped`][] hook instead, which is optimized for this use case.

```tsx
// ❌ Mapping is hard to get right with this hook
const cursors = useOthers(
  (others) => others.map((other) => other.presence.cursor),
  shallow
);

// ✅ Better to use useOthersMapped
const cursors = useOthersMapped((other) => other.presence.cursor);
```

When called without arguments, returns the user list and updates your component
whenever _anything_ in it changes. This might be way more often than you want!

```tsx
const others = useOthers(); // ⚠️ Caution, might rerender often!
// [
//   { connectionId: 2, presence: { cursor: { x: 27, y: -8 } } },
//   { connectionId: 3, presence: { cursor: { x: 0, y: 19 } } },
// ]
```

<Banner type="error" title="Caution">

In production-ready apps, you likely want to avoid calling `useOthers` without
arguments.

</Banner>

### useOthersMapped

Extract data using a [selector][] for every user in the room, and subscribe to
all changes to the selected data. A [Suspense version][] of this hook is also
available.

The key difference with [`useOthers`][] is that the selector (and the optional
comparison function) work at the _item_ level, like doing a `.map()` over the
others array.

```tsx
// Example 1
const others = useOthersMapped((other) => other.presence.cursor);
// [
//   [2, { x: 27, y: -8 }],
//   [3, { x: 0, y: 19 }],
// ]

// Example 2
const others = useOthersMapped(
  (other) => ({
    avatar: other.info.avatar,
    isTyping: other.presence.isTyping,
  }),
  shallow // 👈
);

// [
//   [2, { avatar: 'https://...', isTyping: true }],
//   [3, { avatar: null, isTyping: false }],
// ]
```

Returns an array where each item is a pair of `[connectionId, data]`. For
pragmatic reasons, the results are keyed by the `connectionId`, because in most
cases you’ll want to iterate over the results and draw some UI for each, which
in React requires you to use a `key={connectionId}` prop.

```tsx
const others = useOthersMapped((other) => other.presence.cursor);

// In JSX
return (
  <>
    {others.map(([connectionId, cursor]) => (
      <Cursor key={connectionId} x={cursor.x} y={cursor.y} />
    ))}
  </>
);
```

### useOthersConnectionIds

Returns an array of connection IDs (numbers), and rerenders automatically when
users join or leave. This hook is useful in particular in combination with the
[`useOther`][] (singular) hook, to implement high-frequency rerendering of
components for each user in the room, e.g. cursors. See the [`useOther`][]
(singular) documentation below for a full usage example.

```tsx
useOthersConnectionIds(); // [2, 4, 7]
```

Roughly equivalent to:

```tsx
useOthers((others) => others.map((other) => other.connectionId), shallow);
```

👉 A [Suspense version][] of this hook is also available.

### useOther

Extract data using a [selector][] for one specific user in the room, and
subscribe to all changes to the selected data. A [Suspense version][] of this
hook is also available.

```tsx
// ✅ Rerenders when this specific user’s isTyping changes (but not when their cursor changes)
const isTyping = useOther(
  3, // User with connectionId 3
  (user) => user.presence.isTyping
);
```

The reason this hook exists is to enable the most efficient rerendering model
for high-frequency updates to other’s presences, which is the following
structure:

```tsx file="Cursors.tsx" highlight="2-3,4,9"
const Cursors =
  // (1) Wrap parent component in a memo and make sure it takes no props
  React.memo(function () {
    const othersConnectionIds = useOthersConnectionIds(); // (2)
    return (
      <>
        {othersConnectionIds.map((connectionId) => (
          <Cursor
            key={connectionId} // (3)
            connectionId={connectionId}
          />
        ))}
      </>
    );
  });
```

```tsx file="Cursor.tsx" highlight="2"
function Cursor({ connectionId }) {
  const { x, y } = useOther(connectionId, (other) => other.presence.cursor); // (4)
  return <Cursor x={x} y={y} />;
}
```

1. Makes sure this whole component tree will never rerender beyond the first
   time.
2. Makes sure the parent component only rerenders when users join/leave.
3. Makes sure each cursor remains associated to the same connection.
4. Makes sure each cursor rerenders whenever _its_ data changes only.

👉 A [Suspense version][] of this hook is also available, which will never
return `null`.

## Broadcast

### useBroadcastEvent

Returns a callback that lets you broadcast custom events to other users in the
room.

```ts highlight="3-5"
import { useBroadcastEvent } from "./liveblocks.config";

// On client A
const broadcast = useBroadcastEvent();
broadcast({ type: "EMOJI", emoji: "🔥" });

// On client B
useEventListener(({ event, user, connectionId }) => {
  //                       ^^^^ Will be Client A
  if (event.type === "EMOJI") {
    // Do something
  }
});
```

### useEventListener

Listen to custom events sent by other people in the room via
[`useBroadcastEvent`][]. Provides the `event` along with the `connectionId` of
the user that sent the message. If an event was sent from the
[Broadcast to a room](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-broadcast-event)
REST API, `connectionId` will be `-1`.

```ts highlight="7-13"
import { useEventListener } from "./liveblocks.config";

// On client A
const broadcast = useBroadcastEvent();
broadcast({ type: "EMOJI", emoji: "🔥" });

// On client B
useEventListener(({ event, user, connectionId }) => {
  //                       ^^^^ Will be Client A
  if (event.type === "EMOJI") {
    // Do something
  }
});
```

The `user` property will indicate which User instance sent the message. This
will typically be equal to one of the others in the room, but it can also be
`null` in case this event was broadcasted from the server, using the
[Broadcast Event API](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-broadcast-event).

Automatically unsubscribes when the component is unmounted.

## Storage

<Banner title="Need help troubleshooting storage?">

Try the [Liveblocks DevTools extension](/devtools) to visualize your
collaborative experiences as you build them, in real-time.

</Banner>

The room’s storage is a conflicts-free state that multiple users can edit at the
same time. It persists even after everyone leaves the room. Liveblocks provides
3 data structures that can be nested to create the state that you want.

- [`LiveObject`][] - Similar to JavaScript object. Use this for storing records
  with fixed key names and where the values don’t necessarily have the same
  types. For example, a `Person` with a `name` (string) and an `age` (number)
  field.

  If multiple clients update the same property simultaneously, the last
  modification received by the Liveblocks servers is the winner.

- [`LiveList`][] - An ordered collection of items synchronized across clients.
  Even if multiple users add/remove/move elements simultaneously, LiveList will
  solve the conflicts to ensure everyone sees the same collection of items.

- [`LiveMap`][] - Similar to a JavaScript Map. Use this for indexing values that
  all have the same structure. For example, to store an index of `Person` values
  by their name. If multiple users update the same property simultaneously, the
  last modification received by the Liveblocks servers is the winner.

`@liveblocks/react` provides a set of hooks that let you interact with the
room’s storage.

### useStorage

Extracts data from Liveblocks Storage state and automatically subscribes to
updates to that selected data. For full details, see [how selectors work][].

```tsx
// ✅ Rerenders if todos (or their children) change
const items = useStorage((root) => root.todos);

// ✅ Rerenders when todos are added or deleted
const numTodos = useStorage((root) => root.todos.length);

// ✅ Rerenders when the value of allDone changes
const allDone = useStorage((root) => root.todos.every((item) => item.done));

// ✅ Rerenders if any _unchecked_ todo items change
const uncheckedItems = useStorage(
  (root) => root.todos.filter((item) => !item.done),
  shallow // 👈
);
```

The `root` argument to the `useStorage` selector function is an _immutable_ copy
of your entire Liveblocks Storage tree. Think of it as the value you provided in
the `initialStorage` prop at the [`RoomProvider`][] level, but then
(recursively) converted to their “normal” JavaScript equivalents (objects,
arrays, maps) that are read-only.

From that immutable `root`, you can select or compute any value you like. Your
component will automatically get rerendered if the value you return differs from
the last rendered value.

This hook returns `null` while storage is still loading. To avoid that, use the
[Suspense version][].

<Banner type="success" title="Avoiding unnecessary rerenders">

It’s recommended to select only the subset of Storage data that your component
needs. This will avoid unnecessary rerenders that happen with overselection.

In order to select one item from a LiveMap within the storage tree with the
`useStorage` method, you can use the example below:

```ts
const key = "errands";
const myTodos = useStorage((root) => root.todoMap.get(key));
```

In order to query a LiveMap, and filter for specific values:

```ts
const myTodos = useStorage(
  root => Array.from(root.todoMap.values()).filter(...),
  shallow,
);
```

</Banner>

### useObject

<Banner title="No longer recommended">

Starting with 0.18, we no longer recommend `useObject`. Instead, we recommend to
switch to [`useStorage`][] for reading and [`useMutation`][] for writing to
Storage.

</Banner>

Returns the [`LiveObject`][] associated with the provided top-level key in your
Storage root. The key should be a [`LiveObject`][] instance, as populated in the
`initialStorage` prop at the [`RoomProvider`][] level.

The hook returns `null` while the storage is loading, unless you use the
[Suspense version][].

⚠️ **Caveat 1**: This hook can only be used to select top-level keys. You cannot
select nested values from your Storage with this hook.

⚠️ **Caveat 2**: The hook only triggers a rerender if direct keys or values of
the [`LiveObject`][] are updated, but it does _not_ trigger a rerender if any of
its nested values get updated.

```tsx file="index.tsx"
import { LiveObject } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";
import { Component } from "./Component";

export function App() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider
      id="my-room-id"
      initialStorage={{
        mathematician: new LiveObject({
          firstName: "Ada",
          lastName: "Lovelace",
        }),
      }}
    >
      <Component />
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

```tsx file="Component.tsx"
import { useObject } from "./liveblocks.config";

function Component() {
  const object = useObject("mathematician");

  if (object == null) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  object.get("firstName"); // => "Ada"
  object.get("lastName"); // => "Lovelace"
}
```

👉 A [Suspense version][] of this hook is also available, which will never
return `null`.

### useMap

<Banner title="No longer recommended">

Starting with 0.18, we no longer recommend `useMap`. Instead, we recommend to
switch to [`useStorage`][] for reading and [`useMutation`][] for writing to
Storage.

</Banner>

Returns the [`LiveMap`][] associated with the provided top-level key in your

`initialStorage` prop at the [`RoomProvider`][] level.

The hook returns `null` while the storage is loading, unless you use the

⚠️ **Caveat 1**: This hook can only be used to select top-level keys. You cannot
select nested values from your Storage with this hook.

⚠️ **Caveat 2**: The hook only triggers a rerender if direct entries of the
[`LiveMap`][] are updated, but it does _not_ trigger a rerender if a nested
value gets updated.

```tsx file="index.tsx"
import { LiveMap } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";
import { Component } from "./Component";

export function App() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider

      initialStorage={{
        fruitsByName: new LiveMap([
          ["apple", "🍎"],
          ["banana", "🍌"],
          ["cherry", "🍒"],
        ]),
      }}
    >
      <Component />
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

```tsx file="Component.tsx"
import { useMap } from "./liveblocks.config";

function Component() {
  const fruitsByName = useMap("fruitsByName");

  if (fruitsByName == null) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  fruitsByName.get("cherry"); // => "🍒"
}
```

### useList

<Banner title="No longer recommended">

Starting with 0.18, we no longer recommend `useList`. Instead, we recommend to
switch to [`useStorage`][] for reading and [`useMutation`][] for writing to
Storage.

</Banner>

Returns the [`LiveList`][] associated with the provided top-level key in your
Storage root. The key should be a [`LiveList`][] instance, as populated in the
`initialStorage` prop at the [`RoomProvider`][] level.

The hook returns `null` while the storage is loading, unless you use the

        animals: new LiveList(["🦁", "🦊", "🐵"]),
      }}
    >
      <Component />
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

```tsx file="Component.tsx"
import { useList } from "./liveblocks.config";

function Component() {
  const animals = useList("animals");

  if (animals == null) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  animals.toArray(); // => ["🦁", "🦊", "🐵"]
}
```

👉 A [Suspense version][] of this hook is also available, which will never
return `null`.

### useBatch

<Banner title={<>You may not need <code>useBatch</code></>}>

Starting with 0.18, we recommend using [`useMutation`][] for writing to Storage,
which will automatically batch all mutations.

</Banner>

Returns a function that batches modifications made during the given function.
All the modifications are sent to other clients in a single message. All the
modifications are merged in a single history item (undo/redo). All the
subscribers are called only after the batch is over.

```tsx
import { useBatch } from "./liveblocks.config";

const batch = useBatch();
batch(() => {
  // All modifications made in this callback are batched
});
```

### useHistory

Returns the room’s history. See [`Room.history`][] for more information.

```ts
import { useHistory } from "./liveblocks.config";

const { undo, redo, pause, resume } = useHistory();
```

### useUndo

Returns a function that undoes the last operation executed by the current
client. It does not impact operations made by other clients.

```ts
import { useUndo } from "./liveblocks.config";

const undo = useUndo();
```

### useRedo

Returns a function that redoes the last operation executed by the current
client. It does not impact operations made by other clients.

```ts
import { useRedo } from "./liveblocks.config";

const redo = useRedo();
```

### useCanUndo

Returns whether there are any operations to undo.

```ts
import { useCanUndo, useUpdateMyPresence } from "./liveblocks.config";

const updateMyPresence = useUpdateMyPresence();
const canUndo = useCanUndo();

updateMyPresence({ y: 0 });

// At the next render, "canUndo" will be true
```

### useCanRedo

Returns whether there are any operations to redo.

```ts
import { useCanRedo, useUndo, useUpdateMyPresence } from "./liveblocks.config";

const updateMyPresence = useUpdateMyPresence();
const undo = useUndo();
const canRedo = useCanRedo();

updateMyPresence({ y: 0 });
undo();

// At the next render, "canRedo" will be true
```

### useMutation

Creates a callback function that lets you mutate Liveblocks state.

```tsx
const fillWithRed = useMutation(
  // Mutation context is passed as the first argument
  ({ storage, setMyPresence }) => {
    // Mutate Storage
    storage.get("shapes").get("circle1").set("fill", "red");
    //                                   ^^^

    // ...or Presence
    setMyPresence({ lastUsedColor: "red" });
  },
  []
);

// JSX
return <button onClick={fillWithRed} />;
```

To make the example above more flexible and work with _any_ color, you have two
options:

1. Close over a local variable and
   [adding it to the dependency array](#useMutation-dep-arrays), or
2. Have it take [an extra callback parameter](#useMutation-extra-params).

Both are equally fine, just a matter of preference.

#### With dependency arrays [#useMutation-dep-arrays]

```tsx highlight="9"
// Local state maintained outside Liveblocks
const [currentColor, setCurrentColor] = useState("red");

const fillWithCurrentColor = useMutation(
  ({ storage, setMyPresence }) => {
    storage.get("shapes").get("circle1").set("fill", currentColor);
    setMyPresence({ lastUsedColor: currentColor });
  },
  [currentColor] // Works just like it would in useCallback
);

// JSX
return <button onClick={fillWithCurrentColor} />;
```

<Banner type="success" title="Tip! Let ESLint check your dependencies">

If you use ESLint, we recommend to
[configure it to enforce](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMutation-lint-rule)
the correct use of your dependency arrays.

</Banner>

#### With extra callback parameters [#useMutation-extra-params]

Alternatively, you can add extra parameters to your callback function:

```tsx highlight="2,3,11,12"
const fill = useMutation(
  // Note the second argument
  ({ storage, setMyPresence }, color: string) => {
    storage.get("shapes").get("circle1").set("fill", color);
    setMyPresence({ lastUsedColor: color });
  },
  []
);

// JSX
return <button onClick={() => fill("red")} />;
//                            ^^^^^^^^^^^ Now fill takes a color argument
```

#### Depending on current presence [#useMutation-presence]

For convenience, the mutation context also receives `self` and `others`
arguments, which are _immutable_ values reflecting the current Presence state,
in case your mutation depends on it.

For example, here’s a mutation that will delete all the shapes selected by the
current user.

```tsx highlight="3,6"
const deleteSelectedShapes = useMutation(
  // You can use current "self" or "others" state in the mutation
  ({ storage, self, others, setMyPresence }) => {
    // Delete the selected shapes
    const shapes = storage.get("shapes");
    for (const shapeId of self.presence.selectedShapeIds) {
      shapes.delete(shapeId);
    }

    // Clear the current selection
    setMyPresence({ selectedShapeIds: [] });
  },
  []
);

// JSX
return <button onClick={deleteSelectedShapes} />;
```

Mutations are automatically batched, so when using `useMutation` there’s no need
to use `useBatch`, or call `room.batch()` manually.

#### ESLint rule [#useMutation-lint-rule] [@keywords=["exhaustive-deps", "additionalHooks", "eslint-plugin-react-hooks"]]

If you are using ESLint in your project, and are using
[the React hooks plugin](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#eslint-plugin),
we recommend to add a check for "additional hooks", so that it will also check
the dependency arrays of your `useMutation` calls:

```js
{
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": ["warn", {
      "additionalHooks": "useMutation"
    }]
  }
}
```

### useThreads

Returns the threads within the current room.

```tsx
import { useThreads } from "./liveblocks.config";

const { threads, error, isLoading } = useThreads();
```

👉 A [Suspense version][] of this hook is also available, which will never
return a loading state and will throw when there's an error.

### useUser

Returns user info from a given user ID.

```tsx
import { useUser } from "./liveblocks.config";

const { user, error, isLoading } = useUser("user-id");
```

👉 A [Suspense version][] of this hook is also available, which will never
return a loading state and will throw when there's an error.

<Banner title="Providing a resolver function">

To use `useUser`, you should provide a resolver function to the
[`resolveUser`](#resolveUser) option in
[`createRoomContext`](#createRoomContext).

</Banner>

### useCreateThread

Returns a function that creates a thread with an initial comment, and optionally
some metadata.

```tsx
const createThread = useCreateThread();
const thread = createThread({ body: {}, metadata: {} });
```

### useEditThreadMetadata

Returns a function that edits a thread’s metadata.

```tsx
const editThreadMetadata = useEditThreadMetadata();
const thread = editThreadMetadata({ threadId: "th_xxx", metadata: {} });
```

### useCreateComment

Returns a function that adds a comment to a thread.

```tsx
const createComment = useCreateComment();
const comment = createComment({ threadId: "th_xxx", body: {} });
```

### useEditComment

Returns a function that edits a comment’s body.

```tsx
const editComment = useEditComment();
const comment = editComment({
  threadId: "th_xxx",
  commentId: "cm_xxx",
  body: {},
});
```

### useDeleteComment

Returns a function that deletes a comment. If it is the last non-deleted
comment, the thread also gets deleted.

```tsx
const deleteComment = useDeleteComment();
deleteComment({ threadId: "th_xxx", commentId: "cm_xxx" });
```

## Helpers

### shallow

Compares two values shallowly. This can be used as the second argument to
selector based functions to loosen the equality check:

```tsx
const redShapes = useStorage(
  (root) => root.shapes.filter((shape) => shape.color === "red"),
  shallow // 👈 here
);
```

The default way [selector results](#selectors-return-arbitrary-values) are
compared is by checking referential equality (`===`). If your selector returns
computed arrays (like in the example above) or objects, this will not work.

By passing `shallow` as the second argument, you can “loosen” this check. This
is because `shallow` will shallowly compare the members of an array (or values
in an object):

```tsx
// Comparing arrays
shallow([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]); // true

// Comparison objects
shallow({ a: 1 }, { a: 1 }); // true
```

Please note that this will only do a shallow (one level deep) check. Hence the
name. If you need to do an arbitrarily deep equality check, you’ll have to write
a custom equality function or use a library like Lodash for that.

## How selectors work [#selectors] [@keywords=["useStorage", "useSelf", "useOthers", "useOther", "useOthersMapped", "useOthersConnectionIds", "selectors", "comparison"]]

The concepts and behaviors described in this section apply to all of our
selector hooks: [`useStorage`][] , [`useSelf`][] , [`useOthers`][] ,
[`useOthersMapped`][], and [`useOther`][] (singular).

```tsx file="Component.tsx"
const child = useStorage((root) => root.child);
const nested = useStorage((root) => root.child.nested);
const total = useStorage((root) => root.x + root.y);
const merged = useStorage((root) => [...root.items, ...root.more], shallow);
```

<Banner title="Examples are illustrated via useStorage">

In this section, `useStorage` is used as the canonical example. This is for
illustration purposes only. The described concepts and behaviors apply equally
to the other selector hooks.

</Banner>

In a nutshell, the key behaviors for all selector APIs are:

- They [receive immutable data](#selectors-receive-immutable-data)
- They [return arbitrary values](#selectors-return-arbitrary-values)
- They [auto-subscribe to updates](#selectors-subscribe-to-updates)

Let’s go over these traits and responsibilities in the next few sections.

### Selectors receive immutable data [#selectors-receive-immutable-data]

The received input to all selector functions is a **read-only** and
**immutable** top level context value that differs for each hook:

- `useStorage((root) => ...)` receives the Storage root
- `useSelf((me) => ...)` receives the current user
- `useOthers((others) => ...)` receives a list of other users in the room
- `useOthersMapped((other) => ...)` receives each individual other user in the
  room
- `useOther(connectionId, (other) => ...)` receives a specific user in the room

For example, suppose you have set up Storage in the typical way by setting
`initialStorage` in your [`RoomProvider`][] to a tree that describes your app’s
data model using `LiveList`, `LiveObject`, and `LiveMap`. The "root" argument
for your selector function, however, will receive **an immutable and read-only
representation** of that Storage tree, consisting of "normal" JavaScript
datastructures. This makes consumption much easier.

```tsx file="Component.tsx"
function Component() {
  useStorage((root) => ...);
  //          ^^^^
  //          Read-only. No mutable Live structures in here.
  //
  //          {
  //            animals: ["🦁", "🦊", "🐵"],
  //            mathematician: { firstName: "Ada", lastName: "Lovelace" },
  //            fruitsByName: new Map([
  //              ["apple", "🍎"],
  //              ["banana", "🍌"],
  //              ["cherry", "🍒"],
  //            ])
  //          }
  //
}
```

Internally, these read-only trees use a technique called **structural sharing**.
This means that between rerenders, if nodes in the tree did not change, they
will **guarantee** to return the same memory instance. Selecting and returning
these nodes directly is therefore safe and considered a good practice, because
they are stable references by design.

### Selectors return arbitrary values [#selectors-return-arbitrary-values] [@keywords=["shallow"]]

```tsx file="Component.tsx"
const animals = useStorage((root) => root.animals);
// ["🦁", "🦊", "🐵"]

const ada = useStorage((root) => root.mathematician);
// { firstName: "Ada", lastName: "Lovelace" }

const fullname = useStorage(
  (root) => `${root.mathematician.firstName} ${root.mathematician.lastName}`
);
// "Ada Lovelace"

const fruits = useStorage((root) => [...root.fruitsByName.values()], shallow);
// ["🍎", "🍌", "🍒"]
```

Selectors you write can return _any_ value. You can use it to “just” select
nodes from the root tree (first two examples above), but you can also return
computed values, like in the last two examples.

#### Selector functions must return a stable result

One important rule is that selector functions **must return a stable result** to
be efficient. This means calling the same selector twice with the same argument
should return two results that are _referentially equal_. Special care needs to
be taken when filtering or mapping over arrays, or when returning object
literals, because those operations create new array or object instances on every
call (the reason why is detailed
[in the next section](#selectors-subscribe-to-updates)).

#### Examples of stable results

<dl>
  <dt>✅ `(root) => root.animals` is stable</dt>
  <dd>
    Liveblocks guarantees this. All nodes in the Storage tree are stable
    references as long as their contents don’t change.
  </dd>
  <dt>️️⚠️ `(root) => root.animals.map(...)` is not stable</dt>
  <dd>
    Because `.map()` creates a new array instance every time. You’ll need to use
    [`shallow`][] here.
  </dd>
  <dt>✅ `(root) => root.animals.map(...).join(", ")` is stable</dt>
  <dd>
    Because `.join()` ultimately returns a string and all primitive values are
    always stable.
  </dd>
</dl>

#### Use a shallow comparison if the result isn’t stable

If your selector function doesn’t return a stable result, it will lead to an
explosion of unnecessary rerenders. In most cases, you can use a [`shallow`][]
comparison function to loosen the check:

```tsx
import { shallow } from "@liveblocks/react";

// ❌ Bad - many unnecessary rerenders
const uncheckedItems = useStorage((root) =>
  root.todos.filter((item) => !item.done)
);

// ✅ Great
const uncheckedItems = useStorage(
  (root) => root.todos.filter((item) => !item.done),
  shallow // 👈 The fix!
);
```

If your selector function constructs complex objects, then a [`shallow`][]
comparison may not suffice. In those advanced cases, you can provide your own
custom comparison function, or use `_.isEqual` from Lodash.

### Selectors auto-subscribe to updates [#selectors-subscribe-to-updates]

Selectors effectively automatically subscribe your components to updates to the
selected or computed values. This means that your component will **automatically
rerender** when the selected value changes.

Using **multiple selector hooks** within a single React component is perfectly
fine. Each such hook will individually listen for data changes. The component
will rerender if _at least one_ of the hooks requires it. If more than one
selector returns a new value, the component _still only rerenders once_.

Technically, deciding if a rerender is needed works by re-running your selector
function `(root) => root.child` every time something changes inside Liveblocks
storage. Anywhere. That happens often in a busy multiplayer app! The reason why
this is still no problem is that even though `root` will be a different value on
every change, `root.child` will not be if it didn’t change (due to how
Liveblocks internally uses structural sharing).

Only once the returned value is different from the previously returned value,
the component will get rerendered. Otherwise, your component will just remain
idle.

Consider the case:

```tsx
function Component() {
  const animals = useStorage((root) => root.animals);
}
```

And the following timeline:

- First render, `root.animals` initially is `["🦁", "🦊", "🐵"]`.
- Then, something unrelated elsewhere in Storage is changed. In response to the
  change, `root.animals` gets re-evaluated, but it still returns the same
  (unchanged) array instance.
- Since the value didn’t change, no rerender is needed.
- Then, someone removes an animal from the list. In response to the change,
  `root.animals` gets re-evaluated, and now it returns `["🦁", "🦊"]`.
- Because the previous value and this value are different, the component will
  rerender, seeing the updated value.

## Adopting Suspense [#suspense] [@keywords=["null"]]

Starting with 0.18, you can use Liveblocks hooks with React’s
[Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#suspense).

The benefit of using Suspense with Liveblocks is that the hooks will no longer
return `null` when Liveblocks is still loading. Instead, you can let your
Suspense boundary handle the still-loading case centrally by showing the
fallback state.

This can turn code like this:

```tsx
// This example uses the "normal" version of useSelf

function MyComponent() {
  const cursor = useSelf((me) => me.presence.cursor);

  // Liveblocks hasn’t loaded yet...
  if (cursor === null) {
    return null;
  }

  const { x, y } = cursor;
  return <Cursor x={x} y={y} />;
}
```

Into:

```tsx
// This example uses the "Suspense" version of useSelf

function MyComponent() {
  // Will never be null, so you can directly unpack 👍
  const { x, y } = useSelf((me) => me.presence.cursor);
  return <Cursor x={x} y={y} />;
}
```

### Importing the special Suspense hooks [#suspense-hooks]

To start using the special “Suspense versions” of our hooks, you can simply
import them from under the `suspense` key in the object returned by the
`createRoomContext` call. All the hooks have the same name, so switching is
easy.

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="2"
export const {
  suspense: {
    RoomProvider,
    useHistory,
    useSelf,
    useOthers,
    useStorage,
    /* ... */
  },
} = createRoomContext(client);
```

Now all these hooks will no longer return `null` values while Liveblocks is
still loading, and instead suspend rendering.

<Banner type="success" title="Keep things simple">

While you can absolutely use a mix of normal and Suspense hooks in your app
without a problem, we don’t recommend it to keep things simple. We suggest to
either get all hooks in their normal versions, or get them all as their Suspense
versions. Even hooks that don’t strictly have a “Suspense version”—like
`RoomProvider` or `useHistory`—are still available under the `suspense` key for
convenience.

</Banner>

### Setting up the Suspense boundary [#suspense-boundary-setup]

Next, you’ll have to wrap your app in a `<Suspense>` boundary where you want to
centrally handle the loading state.

Normally, this looks like:

```tsx highlight="1,6"
import { Suspense } from "react";

function Page() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider /* ... */>
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <App />
      </Suspense>
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

The above works fine if your app only runs in a browser. If your project uses
server-side rendering (e.g. Next.js app), then the above solution won’t work and
throw errors. In that case, please read on.

### Avoid calling Suspense hooks on the server side [#suspense-avoid-ssr]

One caveat with the Suspense hooks is that they cannot be run on the server
side, as they will throw an error. So you’ll need to avoid rendering those
components on the server side.

Fortunately, this is easy to avoid with a tiny helper component we ship with our
React package. It can be used in place of React’s default `<Suspense>`, almost
as a drop-in replacement. This helper will make sure to always render the
`fallback` on the server side, and only ever rendering its children on the
client side, when it’s no problem.

```tsx highlight="2,7-8"
// Drop-in replacement for standard `Suspense`
import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";

function Page() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider /* ... */>
      <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        {() => <App />}
      </ClientSideSuspense>
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```
