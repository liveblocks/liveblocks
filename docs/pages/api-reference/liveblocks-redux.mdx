`@liveblocks/redux` provides you with [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
bindings for our real-time collaboration APIs, built on top of WebSockets. Read
our [getting started](/docs/get-started) guides to learn more.

## Enhancer

Enhancer that lets you connect a Redux state to Liveblocks Presence and Storage
features.

```js
import { liveblocksEnhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: /* reducer */,
  enhancers: [
    liveblocksEnhancer({
      client,
      storageMapping: {},
      presenceMapping: {},
    }),
  ],
});
```

### client [#enhancer-option-client]

See different authentication methods in the [`createClient`][] method.

```js highlight="1,4-6,12"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { liveblocksEnhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";

const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: /* reducer */,
  enhancers: [
    liveblocksEnhancer({
      client,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### presenceMapping [#enhancer-option-presence-mapping]

Mapping used to synchronize a part of your Redux state with one Liveblocks room
presence.

```js highlight="20"
import { liveblocksEnhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";

const initialState = {
  cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 },
};

const slice = createSlice({
  name: "state",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    /* reducers */
  },
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: slice.reducer,
  enhancers: [
    liveblocksEnhancer({
      client,
      presenceMapping: { cursor: true },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### storageMapping [#enhancer-option-storage-mapping]

Mapping used to synchronize a part of your Redux state with one Liveblocks Room
storage.

```js highlight="20"
import { liveblocksEnhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";

const initialState = {
  scientist: { name: "" },
};

const slice = createSlice({
  name: "state",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    /* reducers */
  },
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: slice.reducer,
  enhancers: [
    liveblocksEnhancer({
      client,
      storageMapping: { scientist: true },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Actions

### ENTER [#actions-enter]

Dispatch `enterRoom` action to enter a room and start sync it with Redux state.

- `roomId`: The `id` of the room.

```js
import { actions } from "@liveblocks/redux";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";

const dispatch = useDispatch();

dispatch(actions.enterRoom("roomId"));
```

### LEAVE [#actions-leave]

Dispatch `leaveRoom` action to leave a room and stop sync it with Redux state.

- `roomId`: The `id` of the room.

```js
import { actions } from "@liveblocks/redux";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";

const dispatch = useDispatch();

dispatch(actions.leaveRoom("roomId"));
```

## state.liveblocks [#liveblocks-state]

Liveblocks extra state attached by the enhancer.

### others [#liveblocks-state-others]

Other users in the room. Empty when no room is currently synced.

```js
const others = useSelector((state) => state.liveblocks.others);
```

### isStorageLoading [#liveblocks-state-is-storage-loading]

Whether or not the room storage is currently loading.

```js
const connection = useSelector((state) => state.liveblocks.isStorageLoading);
```

### status [#liveblocks-state-status]

Gets the current WebSocket connection status of the room.

```js
const {
  liveblocks: { status },
} = useStore();
```

The possible value are: `initial`, `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, or
`disconnected`.

### connection (legacy) [#liveblocks-state-connection]

<Banner title="Deprecated since 1.1" type="warning">

Support for this property will be removed in a future version. We recommend
switching to the newer and simpler [`status`][] property instead.

</Banner>

Legacy connection status of the room. This property exists for backward
compatibility reasons, but itâ€™s no longer recommended.

The value can be: `authenticating`, `connecting`, `open`, `failed`, `closed` or
`unavailable`.

```js
const connection = useSelector((state) => state.liveblocks.connection);
```
