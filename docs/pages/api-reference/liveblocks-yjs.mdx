## LiveblocksProvider [#LiveblocksProvider]

`LiveblocksProvider` is a [Yjs provider](https://github.com/yjs/yjs#providers)
that allows you to connect a Yjs document to Liveblocks. Any changes you make to
the document will be stored on Liveblocks servers and synchronized with other
clients in the room.

You can connect by creating a Yjs document, then passing it to
`LiveblocksProvider` along with the currently connected Liveblocks room.

```ts highlight="11-13"
import * as Y from "yjs";
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import LiveblocksProvider from "@liveblocks/yjs";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});

const room = client.enter("your-room-id", { initialPresence: {} });

// Create Yjs document and provider
const yDoc = new Y.Doc();
const yProvider = new LiveblocksProvider(room, yDoc);
```

When using [`@liveblocks/react`][] you can connect by using `LiveblocksProvider`
within an effect, taking the room from [`useRoom`][], and cleaning up
afterwards.

```ts highlight="7,10-12"
import { useEffect } from "react";
import * as Y from "yjs";
import LiveblocksProvider from "@liveblocks/yjs";
import { useRoom } from "../liveblocks.config.ts";

function Component() {
  const room = useRoom();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Create Yjs document and provider
    const yDoc = new Y.Doc();
    const yProvider = new LiveblocksProvider(room, yDoc);

    // ...

    return () => {
      yDoc.destroy();
      yProvider.destroy();
    };
  }, [room]);

  // ...
}
```

### LiveblocksProvider.awareness [#LiveblocksProvider.awareness]

The [awareness](#Awareness) instance attached to the provider.

```ts
// Yjs awareness
const awareness = yProvider.awareness;
```

### LiveblocksProvider.destroy

Cleanup function. Destroys the [`LiveblocksProvider`][] instance and removes all
resources.

```ts
// Clean up yProvider
yProvider.destroy();
```

### LiveblocksProvider.on("sync") [#LiveblocksProvider.on.sync]

Add an event listener for the `sync` event. The `sync` event is triggered when
the client has received content from the server. Can be used to fire events when
the document has loaded.

```ts
// Listen for the sync event
yProvider.on("sync", (isSynced: boolean) => {
  if (isSynced === true) {
    // Yjs content is synchronized and ready
  } else {
    // Yjs content is not synchronized
  }
});
```

Aliased by `LiveblocksProvider.on("synced")`.

```ts
// "sync" and "synced" both listen to the same event
yProvider.on("sync", (sync: boolean) => /* ... */);
yProvider.on("synced", (sync: boolean) => /* ... */);
```

### LiveblocksProvider.off("sync") [#LiveblocksProvider.off.sync]

Remove an event listener for the `sync` event. The `sync` event is triggered
when the client has received content from the server. Used to clean up
[`LiveblocksProvider.on("sync")`][].

```ts
const handleSync = (synced: boolean) => {};
yProvider.on("sync", handleSync);

// Clean up sync event
yProvider.off("sync", handleSync);
```

Aliased by `LiveblocksProvider.on("synced")`.

```ts
// "sync" and "synced" both listen to the same event
yProvider.off("sync", (sync: boolean) => /* ... */);
yProvider.off("synced", (sync: boolean) => /* ... */);
```

### LiveblocksProvider.once("sync") [#LiveblocksProvider.once.sync]

Add a one-time event listener for the `sync` event. The `sync` event is
triggered when the client has received content from the server. Can be used to
fire events when the document has loaded.

```ts
// Listen for the sync event only once
yProvider.on("sync", (isSynced: boolean) => {
  if (isSynced === true) {
    // Yjs content is synchronized and ready
  } else {
    // Yjs content is not synchronized
  }
});
```

Aliased by `LiveblocksProvider.once("synced")`.

```ts
// "sync" and "synced" both listen to the same event
yProvider.once("sync", (sync: boolean) => /* ... */);
yProvider.once("synced", (sync: boolean) => /* ... */);
```

### LiveblocksProvider.emit("sync") [#LiveblocksProvider.emit.sync]

Synchronously call each listener for the `sync` event in the order they were
registered, passing the supplied arguments to each.

```ts
// Call each listener and pass `true` as an argument
yProvider.emit("sync", true);
```

Aliased by `LiveblocksProvider.emit("synced")`.

```ts
// "sync" and "synced" both listen to the same event
yProvider.emit("sync" /* , ... */);
yProvider.emit("synced" /* , ... */);
```

### LiveblocksProvider.synced [#LiveblocksProvider.synced]

Boolean. Returns whether the client is synchronized with the back end.

```ts
// Check if Yjs content is synchronized with the server
const isSynced: boolean = yProvider.synced;
```

### LiveblocksProvider.connect [#LiveblocksProvider.connect]

Does nothing, added for compatibility. Connections are handled by the
[Liveblocks client](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClient).

### LiveblocksProvider.disconnect [#LiveblocksProvider.disconnect]

Does nothing, added for compatibility. Connections are handled by the
[Liveblocks client](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClient).

## Awareness [#Awareness]

[`LiveblocksProvider`][] instances have an `awareness` property, which is
powered by
[Liveblocks Presence](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Room.getPresence).
You can pass it to various bindings which implement awareness, for example
plugins that enable multiplayer cursors in text editors.

```ts
const yDoc = new Y.Doc();
const yProvider = new LiveblocksProvider(room, yDoc);

// Yjs awareness
const awareness = yProvider.awareness;
```

Because awareness is part of presence, it’s also accessible with
[`room.getPresence`][] and [`useMyPresence`][] under the `__yjs` property.

```ts
// Yjs awareness
const awareness = room.getPresence().__yjs;
```

### Awareness.doc [#Awareness.doc]

The Yjs document that the current awareness instance is attached to.

```ts
// The current Yjs document
const yDoc: Y.Doc = awareness.doc;
```

### Awareness.clientId [#Awareness.clientId]

A unique number identifying which client this awareness object is attached to.

```ts
// A unique number representing the current user
const clientId: number = awareness.clientId;
```

### Awareness.getLocalState [#Awareness.getLocalState]

Get the current user’s awareness state.

```ts
// The current user’s awareness
const localState: unknown = awareness.getLocalState();
```

### Awareness.setLocalState [#Awareness.setLocalState]

Set the current user’s awareness state. Accepts JSON-compatible objects.

```ts
// Set the current user’s awareness
awareness.setLocalState({
  user: {
    name: "Jonathan",
  },
});
```

### Awareness.setLocalStateField [#Awareness.setLocalStateField]

Set a single property in the current user’s awareness state. Accepts
JSON-compatible objects, or `null` to remove a property.

```ts
// Set a single property on the current user’s awareness
awareness.setLocalStateField("user", { name: "Jonathan" });
```

### Awareness.getStates [#Awareness.getStates]

Returns a `Map` of states for each client, with each user’s unique `clientId` as
the key.

```ts
// A Map of each user’s awareness state
const states: Map<number, unknown> = awareness.getStates();
```

### Awareness.states [#Awareness.states]

A `Map` of states for each client, with each user’s unique `clientId` as the
key.

```ts
// A Map of each user’s awareness state
const states: Map<number, unknown> = awareness.states;
```

### Awareness.meta [#Awareness.meta]

Provided for compatibility, but generally not necessary. This would be used for
handling user awareness timeouts, but internally awareness uses Liveblocks
Presence, and this handles it for you.

```ts
const meta: Map<number, { click: number; lastUpdated: number }> =
  awareness.meta;
```

### Awareness.destroy [#Awareness.destroy]

Provided for compatibility, but generally not necessary. Cleanup function.
Destroys the [`Awareness`][] instance and removes all resources. Used internally
by [`LiveblocksProvider`][].

```ts
// Cleanup function
awareness.destroy();
```

### Awareness.on("destroyed") [#Awareness.on.destroyed]

Provided for compatibility, but generally not necessary. Add an event listener
for the `destroy` event. The `destroy` event is triggered when
[`awareness.destroy`][] has been called.

```ts
awareness.on("destroyed", () => {
  // Awareness has been cleaned up
});
```

### Awareness.off("destroyed") [#Awareness.off.destroyed]

Provided for compatibility, but generally not necessary. Remove an event
listener for the `destroy` event. The `destroy` event is triggered when
[`awareness.destroy`][] has been called. Used to clean up
[`Awareness.on("destroyed")`.]

```ts
const handleDestroy = () => {};
awareness.on("destroyed", handleDestroy);

// Clean up destroy event
awareness.off("destroyed", handleDestroy);
```

### Awareness.once("destroyed") [#Awareness.once.destroyed]

Provided for compatibility, but generally not necessary. Add a one-time event
listener for the `destroy` event. The `destroy` event is triggered when
[`awareness.destroy`][] has been called.

```ts
awareness.once("destroyed", () => {
  // Awareness has been cleaned up
});
```

### Awareness.emit("destroyed") [#Awareness.emit.destroyed]

Synchronously call each listener for the `destroy` event in the order they were
registered, passing the supplied arguments to each.

```ts
// Call each listener and pass `true` as an argument
awareness.emit("destroy", true);
