`@liveblocks/yjs` is a [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/) provider enabling you to use
Liveblocks as the hosted back end of your real-time collaborative application.
Read our [getting started](/docs/get-started) guides to learn more.

## LiveblocksProvider

The `LiveblocksProvider` lets you connect a Yjs doc to Liveblocks Presence and
Storage features. Any changes you make to the Yjs doc will be stored on
Liveblocks servers and synced with other clients in the room.

```js
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import LiveblocksProvider from "@liveblocks/yjs";
import * as Y from "yjs";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});

const room = client.enter("your-room-id", { initialPresence: {} });
const doc = new Y.Doc();

const provider = new LiveblocksProvider(room, doc);
```

## Awareness

A `LiveblocksProvider` has an `awareness` property, backed by Liveblocks
Presence. You can pass it to various bindings which implement awareness.
