`@liveblocks/client` provides you with JavaScript bindings for our real-time
collaboration APIs, built on top of WebSockets. Read our
[getting started](/docs/get-started) guides to learn more.

## createClient

Create a client that will be responsible to communicate with Liveblocks servers.

### createClient with public key [#createClientPublicKey]

When creating a client with a public key, you don’t need to set up an
authorization endpoint:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});
```

### createClient with auth endpoint [#createClientAuthEndpoint]

If you are not using a public key, you need to set up your own `authEndpoint`.
Please refer to our [Authentication guide](/docs/rooms/authentication).

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({ authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth" });
```

### createClient with callback [#createClientCallback]

If you need to add additional headers or use your own function to call the
endpoint, `authEndpoint` can be provided as a custom callback.

Your async function should return either of the following values:

1. **A valid token.** Return a `{ "token": "..." }` shaped response.
1. **Explicitly forbid access.** Return an
   `{ "error": "forbidden", "reason": "..." }` shaped response. If you return
   this response, the client will disconnect and won't keep trying to authorize.

Any other error will be treated as an unexpected error, after which the client
will retry making the request until it gets either (1) or (2).

You’re responsible for making the fetch to your own backend. Example
implementation:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: async (room) => {
    const response = await fetch("/api/liveblocks-auth", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authentication: "<your own headers here>",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ room }), // Don't forget to pass `room` down
    });
    return await response.json();
  },
});
```

### createClient for React Native [#createClientReactNative]

If you want to use `@liveblocks/client` with
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), you need to add an [`atob`][]
polyfill.

As a polyfill, we recommend installing the package [`base-64`][].

```bash
npm install base-64
```

Then you can pass the `decode` function to our `atob` polyfill option when you
create the client.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { decode } from "base-64";

const client = createClient({
  /* ... other options ... */
  polyfills: {
    atob: decode,
  },
});
```

### createClient for Node.js [#createClientNode]

If you want to use `@liveblocks/client` in a Node.js environment, you need to
provide [`WebSocket`][] and [`fetch`][] polyfills.

As polyfills, we recommend installing the packages [`ws`][] and
[`node-fetch`][].

```bash
npm install ws node-fetch
```

Then, pass them to the `createClient` function as below.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import fetch from "node-fetch";
import WebSocket from "ws";

const client = createClient({
  /* ... other options ... */
  polyfills: {
    fetch,
    WebSocket,
  },
});
```

Note that `node-fetch` v3+
[does not support CommonJS](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/blob/main/docs/v3-UPGRADE-GUIDE.md#converted-to-es-module).
If you are using CommonJS, downgrade `node-fetch` to v2.

### WebSocket throttle [#createClientThrottle]

By default, the client throttles the WebSocket messages sent to 100
milliseconds.

It is possible to override that configuration with the `throttle` option.

`throttle` should be between 16 and 1000 milliseconds.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  /* ... other options ... */
  throttle: 16,
});
```

### Lost connection timeout [#createClientLostConnectionTimeout]

If you’re connected to a room and you briefly lose connection, Liveblocks will
normally reconnect automatically and quickly. However, if this takes longer than
usual (for example, your network is offline), then the room will emit an event
informing you about such exceptional circumstances.

How quickly this happens can be configured with the `lostConnectionTimeout`
setting.

`lostConnectionTimeout` can be set between 1000 (pedantic) and 30000 (very
relaxed) milliseconds. The default is 5000, or 5 seconds.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  /* ... other options ... */
  lostConnectionTimeout: 5000,
});
```

You can listen to the event with [`room.subscribe("lost-connection")`][]. Note
that this also affects when `others` are reset to an empty array after a
disconnection. For a demonstration of this behavior, see our [connection status
example][].

### Background keep-alive timeout [#createClientBackgroundKeepAliveTimeout]

By default, Liveblocks applications will maintain an active WebSocket connection
to the Liveblocks servers, even when running in a browser tab that’s in the
background. However, if you’d prefer for background tabs to disconnect after a
period of inactivity, then you can use `backgroundKeepAliveTimeout`.

When `backgroundKeepAliveTimeout` is specified, the client will automatically
disconnect applications that have been in an unfocused background tab for _at
least_ the specified time. When the browser tab is refocused, the client will
immediately reconnect to the room and synchronize the document.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  /* ... other options ... */
  backgroundKeepAliveTimeout: 15 * 60 * 1000 /* 15 minutes */,
});
```

`backgroundKeepAliveTimeout` accepts a numeric value in milliseconds—we advise
using a value of at least a few minutes, to avoid unnecessary disconnections.

## Client

Client returned by [`createClient`][].

### Client.enterRoom

Enters a room and returns both the local `Room` instance, and a “leave” function
(unsubscribe function). The authentication endpoint is called as soon as you
call this function.

The second argument is a configuration for the presence and storage.

- `initialPresence` - The initial Presence to use for the User currently
  entering the Room. Presence data belongs to the current User and is readable
  to all other Users in the room while the current User is connected to the
  Room. Must be serializable to JSON.
- `initialStorage` (optional) - The initial Storage structure to create when a
  new Room is entered for the first time. Storage data is shared and belongs to
  the Room itself. It persists even after all Users leave the room, and is
  mutable by every client. Must either contain Live structures (e.g.
  `new LiveList()`, `new LiveObject({ a: 1 })`, etc.) or be serializable to
  JSON.
- `autoConnect` (optional) - Whether or not the room immediately connects to
  Liveblocks servers. Default is `true`. Usually set to `false` when the client
  is used from the server to not call the authentication endpoint or connect via
  WebSocket.

```ts
const { room, leave } = client.enterRoom("my-room", {
  initialPresence: { cursor: null },
  initialStorage: { todos: new LiveList() },
});

// Don’t forget to call `leave()` when you’re done with the room
leave();
```

### Client.enter

Enters a room and returns its local `Room` instance.

<Banner title="Deprecated since 1.5" type="warning">

We no longer recommend this API, because issues will occur if you simultaneously
connect to the same room with multiple instances. We recommend using
[`client.enterRoom`][] instead.

</Banner>

```ts
// ❌ This API was recommended before 1.5
const room = client.enter("my-room", {
  initialPresence: { cursor: null },
  initialStorage: { todos: new LiveList() },
});
client.leave(roomId);

// ✅ Prefer this instead
const { room, leave } = client.enterRoom("my-room", {
  initialPresence: { cursor: null },
  initialStorage: { todos: new LiveList() },
});
leave();
```

### Client.leave

Leaves a room.

<Banner title="Deprecated since 1.5" type="warning">

We no longer recommend this API, because issues will occur if you simultaneously
connect to the same room with multiple instances. We recommend using
[`client.enterRoom`][] instead.

</Banner>

```ts
// ❌ This API was recommended before 1.5
client.leave("my-room");

// ✅ Prefer this instead
const { room, leave } = client.enterRoom("my-room" /* options */);
leave();
```

### Client.getRoom

Gets a room by its ID. Returns `null` if [`client.enterRoom`][] has not been
called previously.

```ts
const room = client.getRoom("my-room");
```

You’ll likely not need this API if you’re using the newer [`client.enterRoom`][]
API.

### Client.logout

Purges any auth tokens from the client’s memory. If there are any rooms that are
still connected, they will be forced to reauthorize.

```ts
client.logout();
```

Call this API if you have a single page application (SPA) and you want to log
your user out.

## Room

Room returned by [`client.enterRoom`][] (or [`client.getRoom`][]).

### Room.getPresence

Gets the presence of the current user.

```ts
const presence = room.getPresence();
```

### Room.updatePresence

Updates the presence of the current user. You need only pass the properties you
wish to update—any changes will be merged into the current presence. The entire
presence object will not be replaced.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ x: 0 });
room.updatePresence({ y: 0 });

const presence = room.getPresence();
// presence is equivalent to { x: 0, y: 0 }
```

`updatePresence` accepts an optional argument to add a new item to the undo/redo
stack. See [`room.history`][] for more information.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "xxx" }, { addToHistory: true });
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "yyy" }, { addToHistory: true });
room.history.undo();
// room.getPresence() equals { selectedId: "xxx" }
```

### Room.getOthers

Gets all the other `User`s in the Room.

```ts
const others = room.getOthers();

for (const { connectionId, id, info, presence, isReadOnly } of others) {
  // Do things
}
```

### Room.broadcastEvent

Broadcast an event to other users in the Room. Events broadcast to the room can
be listened to with [`Room.subscribe("event")`][]. Takes a payload as first
argument. Should be serializable to JSON.

By default, broadcasting an event is a “fire and forget” action. If the sending
client is not currently connected to a room, the event is simply discarded. When
passing the `shouldQueueEventIfNotReady` option, the client will queue up the
event, and only send it once the connection to the room is (re)established.

<Banner title="Notice">

We’re not sure if we want to support `shouldQueueEventIfNotReady` in the future,
so it may be deprecated and replaced with something else.

</Banner>

```ts highlight="1-2"
// On client A
room.broadcastEvent({ type: "EMOJI", emoji: "🔥" });

// On client B
room.subscribe("event", ({ event, user, connectionId }) => {
  //                              ^^^^ Will be Client A
  if (event.type === "EMOJI") {
    // Do something
  }
});
```

The `user` property will indicate which User instance sent the message. This
will typically be equal to one of the others in the room, but it can also be
`null` in case this event was broadcasted from the server, using the
[Broadcast Event API](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-broadcast-event).

### Room.getSelf

Gets the current `User`. Returns `null` if it is not yet connected to the room.

```ts
const { connectionId, presence, id, info, isReadOnly } = room.getSelf();
```

### Room.getStatus

Gets the current WebSocket connection status of the room.

```ts
const status = room.getStatus();
```

The possible value are: `initial`, `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, or
`disconnected`.

### Room.subscribe(storageItem)

Subscribe to updates for a particular storage item.

Takes a callback that is called when the storage item is updated.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const { root } = await room.getStorage();
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe(root, (root) => {
  // Do something
});
```

It’s also possible to subscribe to a storage item and its children by passing an
optional `isDeep` parameter. In that case, the callback will get called with a
list of updates instead. Each such update is a `{ type, node, updates }` object.

```ts
const { root } = await room.getStorage();
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe(
  root,
  (storageUpdates) => {
    for (const update of storageUpdates) {
      const {
        type, // "LiveObject", "LiveList", or "LiveMap"
        node,
        updates,
      } = update;
      switch (type) {
        case "LiveObject": {
          // updates["property"]?.type; is "update" or "delete"
          // update.node is the LiveObject that has been updated/deleted
          break;
        }
        case "LiveMap": {
          // updates["key"]?.type; is "update" or "delete"
          // update.node is the LiveMap that has been updated/deleted
          break;
        }
        case "LiveList": {
          // updates[0]?.type; is "delete", "insert", "move", or "set"
          // update.node is the LiveList that has been updated, deleted, or modified
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  },
  { isDeep: true }
);
```

### Room.subscribe("event") [#Room.subscribe.event]

Subscribe to events broadcast by [`Room.broadcastEvent`][].

Takes a callback that is called when a user calls [`Room.broadcastEvent`][].
Provides the `event` along with the `user` and their `connectionId` of the user
that sent the message. If this event was sent via the
[Broadcast to a room](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-broadcast-event)
REST API, `user` will be `null` and `connectionId` will be `-1`.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts highlight="4-10"
// On client A
room.broadcastEvent({ type: "EMOJI", emoji: "🔥" });

// On client B
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("event", ({ event, user, connectionId }) => {
  //                                                  ^^^^ Will be Client A
  if (event.type === "EMOJI") {
    // Do something
  }
});
```

### Room.subscribe("my-presence") [#Room.subscribe.my-presence]

Subscribe to the current user presence updates.

Takes a callback that is called every time the current user presence is updated
with [`Room.updatePresence`][].

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("my-presence", (presence) => {
  // Do something
});
```

### Room.subscribe("others") [#Room.subscribe.others]

Subscribe to the other users updates.

Takes a callback that is called when a user enters or leaves the room or when a
user update its presence.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("others", (others, event) => {
  // Do something

  if (event.type === "leave") {
    // A user has left the room
    // event.user;
  }

  if (event.type === "enter") {
    // A user has entered the room
    // event.user;
  }

  if (event.type === "update") {
    // A user has updated
    // event.user;
    // event.updates;
  }

  if (event.type === "reset") {
    // A disconnection has occurred and others has reset
  }
});
```

### Room.subscribe("status") [#Room.subscribe.status]

Subscribe to WebSocket connection status updates.

Takes a callback that is called whenever the connection status changes. Possible
value are: `initial`, `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, or
`disconnected`.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("status", (status) => {
  // Do something
});
```

This is a low-level API that exposes the WebSocket’s connectivity status. You
can use this, for example, to update a connection status indicator in your UI.
It would be normal for a client to briefly lose the connection and restore it,
using quick `connected` → `reconnecting` → `connected` status jumps.

If you want to let users know that there may be connectivity issues, don’t use
this API, but instead refer to [`Room.subscribe("lost-connection")`][].

<Banner title="Notice">

Do not use this API to detect when Storage or Presence are initialized or
loaded. "Connected" does not guarantee that Storage or Presence are ready. To
detect when Storage is loaded, rely on awaiting the [`Room.getStorage`][]
promise or using the [`Room.subscribe("storage-status")`][] event.

</Banner>

### Room.subscribe("lost-connection") [#Room.subscribe.lost-connection]

A special-purpose event that will fire in the exceptional case where a
previously connected Liveblocks client has lost its connection (e.g. due to a
network outage) and was unable to recover quickly.

This event allows you to build high-quality UIs by warning your users that the
app is still trying to re-establish the connection, for example through a toast
notification. You may want to take extra care in the mean time to ensure their
changes won’t go unsaved, or to help them understand why they’re not seeing
updates made by others yet.

When this happens, this callback is called with the event `lost`. Then, once the
connection restores, the callback will be called with the value `restored`. If
the connection could definitively not be restored, it will be called with
`failed` (uncommon).

The [`lostConnectionTimeout`][] configuration option will determine how quickly
this event will fire after a connection loss (default: 5 seconds).

```ts
import { toast } from "my-preferred-toast-library";

const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("lost-connection", (event) => {
  switch (event) {
    case "lost":
      toast.warn("Still trying to reconnect...");
      break;

    case "restored":
      toast.success("Successfully reconnected again!");
      break;

    case "failed":
      toast.error("Could not restore the connection");
      break;
  }
});
```

### Room.subscribe("connection") [#Room.subscribe.connection]

<Banner title="Deprecated since 1.1" type="warning">

Support for this subscription overload will be removed in a future version. We
recommend switching to [`Room.subscribe("status")`][] instead.

</Banner>

Subscribe to our legacy WebSocket connection status updates.

Takes a callback that is called when the connection status changes.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("connection", (status) => {
  // Do something
});
```

### Room.subscribe("error") [#Room.subscribe.error]

Subscribe to unrecoverable room connection errors. This event will be emitted
right before the client disconnects and won’t try reconnecting again.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("error", (error) => {
  switch (error.code) {
    case -1:
      // Authentication error
      break;

    case 4001:
      // Could not connect because you don't have access to this room
      break;

    case 4005:
      // Could not connect because room was full
      break;

    default:
      // Unexpected error
      break;
  }
});
```

You can use this event to trigger a “Not allowed” screen/dialog. If you’d like
to retry connecting, call `room.reconnect()`.

### Room.subscribe("history") [#Room.subscribe.history]

Subscribe to the current user’s history changes.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("history", ({ canUndo, canRedo }) => {
  // Do something
});
```

### Room.subscribe("storage-status") [#Room.subscribe.storage-status]

Subscribe to storage status changes.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```typescript
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("storage-status", (status) => {
  switch (status) {
    case "not-loaded":
      break;
    case "loading":
      break;
    case "synchronizing":
      break;
    case "synchronized":
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
});
```

### Room.batch

Batches Storage and Presence modifications made during the given function. Each
modification is grouped together, which means that other clients receive the
changes as a single message after the batch function has run. Every modification
made during the batch is merged into a single history item (undo/redo).

```ts
const { root } = await room.getStorage();
room.batch(() => {
  root.set("x", 0);
  room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 100, y: 100 } });
});
```

Note that `room.batch` cannot take an `async` function.

```tsx
// ❌ Won't work
room.batch(async () => /* ... */);

// ✅ Will work
room.batch(() => /*... */);
```

### Room.history

Room’s history contains functions that let you undo and redo operation made on
by the current client on the presence and storage.

```ts
const { undo, redo, pause, resume } = room.history;
```

### Room.history.undo

Undoes the last operation executed by the current client. It does not impact
operations made by other clients.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "xxx" }, { addToHistory: true });
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "yyy" }, { addToHistory: true });
room.history.undo();
// room.getPresence() equals { selectedId: "xxx" }
```

### Room.history.redo

Redoes the last operation executed by the current client. It does not impact
operations made by other clients.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "xxx" }, { addToHistory: true });
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "yyy" }, { addToHistory: true });
room.history.undo();
// room.getPresence() equals { selectedId: "xxx" }
room.history.redo();
// room.getPresence() equals { selectedId: "yyy" }
```

### Room.history.canUndo

Returns whether there are any operations to undo.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "xx" }, { addToHistory: true });
// room.history.canUndo() is true
room.history.undo();
// room.history.canUndo() is false
```

### Room.history.canRedo

Returns whether there are any operations to redo.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "xx" }, { addToHistory: true });
room.history.undo();
// room.history.canRedo() is true
room.history.redo();
// room.history.canRedo() is false
```

### Room.history.clear

Clears the undo and redo stacks for the current client. Explicitly clearing
history resets the ability to undo beyond the current document state. Other
clients’ histories are unaffected.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "xx" }, { addToHistory: true });
// room.history.canUndo() is true
room.history.clear();
// room.history.canUndo() is false
```

### Room.history.pause

All future modifications made on the Room will be merged together to create a
single history item until resume is called.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } }, { addToHistory: true });
room.history.pause();
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }, { addToHistory: true });
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 2, y: 2 } }, { addToHistory: true });
room.history.resume();
room.history.undo();
// room.getPresence() equals { cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } }
```

### Room.history.resume

Resumes history. Modifications made on the Room are not merged into a single
history item anymore.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } }, { addToHistory: true });
room.history.pause();
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }, { addToHistory: true });
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 2, y: 2 } }, { addToHistory: true });
room.history.resume();
room.history.undo();
// room.getPresence() equals { cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } }
```

### Room.getStorageStatus

Get the storage status.

- `not-loaded`: Initial state when entering the room.
- `loading`: Once the storage has been requested via room.getStorage().
- `synchronizing`: When some local updates have not been acknowledged by
  Liveblocks servers.
- `synchronized`: Storage is in sync with Liveblocks servers.

```ts
const status = room.getStorageStatus();
```

### Room.connect

Connect the local room instance to the Liveblocks server. Does nothing if the
room is already connecting, reconnecting or connected.

```ts
room.connect();
```

We don’t recommend using this API directly.

### Room.reconnect

Reconnect the local room instance to the Liveblocks server, using a new
WebSocket connection.

```ts
room.reconnect();
```

### Room.disconnect

Disconnect the local room instance from the Liveblocks server. The room instance
will remain functional (for example, it will still allow local presence or
storage mutations), but since it’s no longer connected, changes will not be
persisted or synchronized until the room instance is reconnected again.

```ts
room.disconnect();
```

We don’t recommend using this API directly.

## Storage

<Banner title="Need help troubleshooting storage?">

Try the [Liveblocks DevTools extension](/devtools) to visualize your
collaborative experiences as you build them, in real-time.

</Banner>

The room’s storage is a conflicts-free state that multiple users can edit at the
same time. It persists even after everyone leaves the room. Liveblocks provides
3 data structures that can be nested to create the state that you want.

- [`LiveObject`][] - Similar to JavaScript object. Use this for storing records
  with fixed key names and where the values don’t necessarily have the same
  types. For example, a `Person` with a `name` (string) and an `age` (number)
  field.

  If multiple clients update the same property simultaneously, the last
  modification received by the Liveblocks servers is the winner.

- [`LiveList`][] - An ordered collection of items synchronized across clients.
  Even if multiple users add/remove/move elements simultaneously, LiveList will
  solve the conflicts to ensure everyone sees the same collection of items.

- [`LiveMap`][] - Similar to a JavaScript Map. Use this for indexing values that
  all have the same structure. For example, to store an index of `Person` values
  by their name. If multiple users update the same property simultaneously, the
  last modification received by the Liveblocks servers is the winner.

### Room.getStorage

Get the room’s storage asynchronously (returns a Promise). The promise will
resolve once the storage’s root is loaded and available.

The storage’s root will always be a [`LiveObject`][].

```ts
const { root } = await room.getStorage();
```

## LiveObject

The `LiveObject` class is similar to a JavaScript object that is synchronized on
all clients. Use this for storing records with fixed key names and where the
values don’t necessarily have the same types. For example, a Person with a
`name` (string) and an `age` (number) field.

Keys should be strings, and values should be serializable to JSON.

If multiple clients update the same property simultaneously, the last
modification received by the Liveblocks servers is the winner.

### new LiveObject [#LiveObject.constructor]

Create an empty `LiveObject`

```ts
const object = new LiveObject();
```

Create a `LiveObject` with initial data.

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Margaret", lastName: "Hamilton" });
```

### delete [#LiveObject.delete]

Delete a property from the `LiveObject`

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Ada", lastName: "Lovelace" });
object.delete("lastName");
object.toObject(); // equals to { firstName: "Ada" }
```

### get [#LiveObject.get]

Get a property from the `LiveObject`

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Ada", lastName: "Lovelace" });
object.get("firstName"); // equals to "Ada"
```

### set [#LiveObject.set]

Adds or updates a property with the specified key and a value.

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Marie" });
object.set("lastName", "Curie");
```

### update [#LiveObject.update]

Adds or updates multiple properties at once.

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" });
object.update({ job: "Computer Scientist", birthDate: "December 9, 1906" });
```

### toObject [#LiveObject.toObject]

<Banner title="Will be deprecated in the future">

Starting with 0.18, we recommend [`toImmutable`][] instead. It’s faster, cached,
and leads to fewer surprises.

</Banner>

Transform the `LiveObject` into a normal JavaScript object.

```ts
const liveObject = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" });
liveObject.toObject();
// { firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" }
```

Please note that this method won’t recursively convert Live structures, which
may be surprising:

```ts
const liveObject = new LiveObject({
  animals: new LiveList(["🦁", "🦊", "🐵"]),
});
liveObject.toObject();
// { animals: <LiveList instance> } // ❗️
```

### toImmutable [#LiveObject.toImmutable]

Returns an immutable JavaScript object that is equivalent to the `LiveObject`.
Nested values will also be immutable.

```ts
const liveObject = new LiveObject({
  firstName: "Grace",
  lastName: "Hopper",
  hobbies: new LiveList(["needlepoint", "reading", "playing piano"]),
});
liveObject.toImmutable();
// {
//   firstName: "Grace",
//   lastName: "Hopper",
//   hobbies: ["needlepoint", "reading", "playing piano"]
// }
```

### clone [#LiveObject.clone]

Returns a deep copy of the `LiveObject` that can be inserted elsewhere in the
Storage tree.

```ts
const obj = new LiveObject(/* ... */);
root.set("a", obj);
root.set("b", obj.clone());
```

## LiveMap

The `LiveMap` class is similar to a
[JavaScript Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
that is synchronized on all clients.

Use this for indexing values that all have the same structure. For example, to
store an index of `Person` values by their name. Keys should be strings, and
values should be serializable to JSON. If multiple clients update the same
property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
servers is the winner.

### new LiveMap [#LiveMap.constructor]

Create an empty `LiveMap`.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap();
```

Create a `LiveMap` with initial data.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);
```

### delete [#LiveMap.delete]

Removes the specified element by key. Returns true if an element existed and has
been removed, or false if the element does not exist.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);
map.delete("keyA"); // equals true
map.get("keyA"); // equals undefined
map.delete("unknownKey"); // equals false
```

### entries [#LiveMap.entries]

Returns a new
[Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)
object that contains the `[key, value]` pairs for each element.

```ts
for (const [key, value] of map.entries()) {
  // Iterate over all the keys and values of the map
}
```

enable the <code>--downlevelIteration</code> option to use this API.

</Banner>

### forEach [#LiveMap.forEach]

// prints to the console "valueA", "valueB"
```

### get [#LiveMap.get]

Returns a specified element from the LiveMap or undefined if the key can’t be
found.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);
map.get("keyA"); // equals "valueA"
map.get("unknownKey"); // equals undefined
```

### has [#LiveMap.has]

Returns a boolean indicating whether an element with the specified key exists or
not.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);
map.has("keyA"); // equals true
map.has("unknownKey"); // equals false
```

### keys [#LiveMap.keys]

Returns a new
[Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)
object that contains the keys for each element.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap();
map.set("keyA", "valueA");
```

### size [#LiveMap.size]

Returns the number of elements in the `LiveMap`.

```ts

```

### values [#LiveMap.values]

Returns a new
[Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)

## Utilities

### getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody [#get-mentioned-ids-from-comment-body]

Returns an array of each user’s ID that has been mentioned in a `CommentBody`
(found under `comment.body`).

```ts
import { getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody } from "@liveblocks/client";

const mentionedIds = getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody(comment.body);
```

Here’s an example with a custom `CommentBody`.

```ts
import {
  CommentBody,
  getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody,
} from "@liveblocks/client";

// Create a custom `CommentBody`
const commentBody: CommentBody = {
  version: 1,
  content: [
    {
      type: "paragraph",
      children: [
        { text: "Hello " },
        { type: "mention", id: "chris@example.com" },
      ],
    },
  ],
};

// Get the mentions inside the comment's body
const mentionedIds = getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody(commentBody);

// ["chris@example.com"]
console.log(mentionedIds);
```
