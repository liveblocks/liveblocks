## createClient

Create a client that will be responsible to communicate with Liveblocks servers.

### createClient with public key [#createClientPublicKey]

When creating a client with a public key, you don’t need to setup an
authorization endpoint:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});
```

### createClient with auth endpoint [#createClientAuthEndpoint]

If you are not using a public key, you need to setup your own `authEndpoint`.
Please refer to our [Authentication guide](/docs/guides/authentication).

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({ authEndpoint: "/api/auth" });
```

### createClient with callback [#createClientCallback]

If you need to add additional headers or use your own function to call the
endpoint, `authEndpoint` also supports a callback.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: async (room) => {
    const response = await fetch("/api/auth", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authentication: "token",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ room }),
    });

    return await response.json();
  },
});
```

### createClient for React Native [#createClientReactNative]

If you want to use `@liveblocks/client` with
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), you need to add an [`atob`][]
polyfill.

As a polyfill, we recommend installing the package [`base-64`][].

```bash
npm install base-64
```

Then you can pass the `decode` function to our `atob` polyfill option when you
create the client.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { decode } from "base-64";

const client = createClient({
  // Other options
  polyfills: {
    atob: decode,
  },
});
```

### createClient for Node.js [#createClientNode]

If you want to use `@liveblocks/client` in a Node.js environment, you need to
provide [`WebSocket`][] and [`fetch`][] polyfills.

As polyfills, we recommend installing the packages [`ws`][] and
[`node-fetch`][].

```bash
npm install ws node-fetch
```

Then, pass them to the `createClient` function as below.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import fetch from "node-fetch";
import WebSocket from "ws";

const client = createClient({
  // Other options
  polyfills: {
    fetch,
    WebSocket,
  },
});
```

Note that `node-fetch` v3+
[does not support CommonJS](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/blob/main/docs/v3-UPGRADE-GUIDE.md#converted-to-es-module).
If you are using CommonJS, downgrade `node-fetch` to v2.

### WebSocket throttle [#createClientThrottle]

By default, the client throttle the WebSocket messages sent to 100 milliseconds.

It is possible to override that configuration with the `throttle` option.

`throttle` should be between 16 and 1000 milliseconds.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  // Other options
  throttle: 16,
});
```

## Client

Client returned by [`createClient`][].

### Client.enter

Enters a room and returns it. The authentication endpoint is called as soon as
you call this function.

The second argument is a configuration for the presence and storage.

- `initialPresence` - The initial Presence to use for the User currently
  entering the Room. Presence data belongs to the current User and is readable
  to all other Users in the room while the current User is connected to the
  Room. Must be serializable to JSON.
- `initialStorage` (optional) - The initial Storage structure to create when a
  new Room is entered for the first time. Storage data is shared and belongs to
  the Room itself. It persists even after all Users leave the room, and is
  mutable by every client. Must either contain Live structures (e.g.
  `new LiveList()`, `new LiveObject({ a: 1 })`, etc.) or be serializable to
  JSON.
- `shouldInitiallyConnect` (optional) - Whether or not the room connects to
  Liveblocks servers. Default is `true`. Usually set to `false` when the client
  is used from the server to not call the authentication endpoint or connect via
  WebSocket.

```ts
const initialPresence = {
  cursor: null,
};

const initialStorage = {
  todos: new LiveList(),
};

const room = client.enter("my-room", {
  initialPresence,
  initialStorage,
});
```

### Client.leave

Leaves a room.

### Client.getRoom

Gets a room by id. Returns `null` if [`client.enter`][] has not been called
previously.

```ts
const room = client.getRoom("my-room");
```

## Room

Room returned by [`client.enter`][] or [`client.getRoom`][].

### Room.getPresence

Gets the presence of the current user.

```ts
const presence = room.getPresence();
```

### Room.updatePresence

Updates the presence of the current user. Only pass the properties you want to
update. No need to send the full presence.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ x: 0 });
room.updatePresence({ y: 0 });

// { x: 0, y: 0 }
room.getPresence();
```

`updatePresence` accepts an optional argument to add a new item to the undo/redo
stack. See [`room.history`][] for more information.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "123" }, { addToHistory: true });
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "456" }, { addToHistory: true });

room.history.undo();

// { selectedId: "123" }
room.getPresence();
```

### Room.getOthers

Gets all the other users in the Room.

```ts
const others = room.getOthers();

for (const { connectionId, id, info, presence, isReadOnly } of others) {
  // Do things
}
```

### Room.broadcastEvent

Broadcast an event to other users in the Room. Events broadcast to the room can
be listened to with [`Room.subscribe("event")`][]. Takes a payload as first
argument. Should be serializable to JSON.

By default, broadcasting an event acts as a “fire and forget”. If the user is
not currently in the room, the event is simply discarded. Passing the
`shouldQueueEventIfNotReady` option will queue the event, before sending it once
the connection is established.

<Banner title="Notice">

We’re not sure if we want to support `shouldQueueEventIfNotReady` in the future,
so it may be deprecated and replaced with something else.

</Banner>

```ts
// On client A
room.broadcastEvent({ type: "EMOJI", emoji: "🔥" });

// On client B
room.subscribe("event", ({ event }) => {
  if (event.type === "EMOJI") {
    // Do something
  }
});
```

### Room.getSelf

Gets the current user. Returns `null` if it is not yet connected to the room.

```ts
const { connectionId, presence, id, info, isReadOnly } = room.getSelf();
```

### Room.subscribe(storageItem)

Subscribe to updates for a particular storage item.

Takes a callback that is called when the storage item is updated.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const { root } = await room.getStorage();

const unsubscribe = room.subscribe(root, (root) => {
  // Do something
});
```

It’s also possible to subscribe to a storage item and its children by passing an
optional `isDeep` parameter. In that case, the callback will get called with a
list of updates instead. Each such update is a `{ type, node }` object.

```ts
const { root } = await room.getStorage();

const unsubscribe = room.subscribe(
  root,
  (updates) => {
    for (const update of updates) {
      const {
        type, // "update" or "delete"
        node,
      } = update;
      switch (node.type) {
        case "LiveObject": {
          // update.node is the LiveObject that has been updated/deleted
          break;
        }
        case "LiveMap": {
          // update.node is the LiveMap that has been updated/deleted
          break;
        }
        case "LiveList": {
          // update.node is the LiveList that has been updated/deleted
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  },
  { isDeep: true }
);
```

### Room.subscribe("event") [#Room.subscribe.event]

Subscribe to events broadcast by [`Room.broadcastEvent`][].

Takes a callback that is called when a user calls [`Room.broadcastEvent`][].

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("event", ({ event, connectionId }) => {
  // Do something
});
```

### Room.subscribe("my-presence") [#Room.subscribe.my-presence]

Subscribe to the current user presence updates.

Takes a callback that is called every time the current user presence is updated
with [`Room.updatePresence`][].

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("my-presence", (presence) => {
  // Do something
});
```

### Room.subscribe("others") [#Room.subscribe.others]

Subscribe to the other users updates.

Takes a callback that is called when a user enters or leaves the room or when a
user update its presence.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("others", (others) => {
  // Do something
});
```

### Room.subscribe("connection") [#Room.subscribe.connection]

Subscribe to the WebSocket connection status updates.

Takes a callback that is called when the connection status changes.

The value can be : `authenticating`, `connecting`, `open`, `failed`, `closed` or
`unavailable`.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("connection", (status) => {
  // Do something
});
```

### Room.subscribe("error") [#Room.subscribe.error]

Subscribe to potential room connection errors.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
const unsubscribe = room.subscribe("error", (error) => {
  if (error.code === 4005) {
    // Maximum concurrent connections per room exceeded
  }
});
```

### Room.subscribe("history") [#Room.subscribe.history]

Subscribe to the current user’s history changes.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```ts
room.subscribe("history", ({ canUndo, canRedo }) => {
  // Do something
});
```

### Room.subscribe("storage-status") [#Room.subscribe.storage-status]

Subscribe to storage status changes.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```typescript
room.subscribe("storage-status", (status) => {
  switch (status) {
    case "not-loaded":
      break;
    case "loading":
      break;
    case "synchronizing":
      break;
    case "synchronized":
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
});
```

### Room.batch

Batches modifications made during the given function.

All the modifications are sent to other clients in a single message.

All the subscribers are called only after the batch is over.

All the modifications are merged in a single history item (undo/redo).

```ts
const { root } = await room.getStorage();

room.batch(() => {
  root.set("x", 0);
  room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 100, y: 100 } });
});
```

### Room.history

Room’s history contains functions that let you undo and redo operation made on
by the current client on the presence and storage.

```ts
const { undo, redo, pause, resume } = room.history;
```

### Room.history.undo

Undoes the last operation executed by the current client. It does not impact
operations made by other clients.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "123" }, { addToHistory: true });
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "456" }, { addToHistory: true });

room.history.undo();

// { selectedId: "123" }
room.getPresence();
```

### Room.history.redo

Redoes the last operation executed by the current client. It does not impact
operations made by other clients.

room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "456" }, { addToHistory: true });

room.history.undo();
room.history.redo();

// { selectedId: "456" }
room.getPresence();
```

### Room.history.canUndo

Returns whether there are any operations to undo.

```ts
// false
room.history.canUndo();

room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "123" }, { addToHistory: true });

// true
room.history.canUndo();
```

### Room.history.canRedo

Returns whether there are any operations to redo.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ selectedId: "123" }, { addToHistory: true });

// false
room.history.canRedo();

room.history.undo();

// true
room.history.canRedo();
```

### Room.history.pause

All future modifications made on the Room will be merged together to create a
single history item until resume is called.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } }, { addToHistory: true });

room.history.pause();

room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }, { addToHistory: true });
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 2, y: 2 } }, { addToHistory: true });

room.history.resume();
room.history.undo();

// { cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } }
room.getPresence();
```

### Room.history.resume

Resumes history. Modifications made on the Room are not merged into a single
history item anymore.

```ts
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } }, { addToHistory: true });

room.history.pause();

room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 1, y: 1 } }, { addToHistory: true });
room.updatePresence({ cursor: { x: 2, y: 2 } }, { addToHistory: true });

room.history.resume();
room.history.undo();

// { cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 } }
room.getPresence();
```

### Room.getStorageStatus

Get the storage status.

- `not-loaded`: Initial state when entering the room.
- `loading`: Once the storage has been requested via room.getStorage().
- `synchronizing`: When some local updates have not been acknowledged by
  Liveblocks servers.
- `synchronized`: Storage is in sync with Liveblocks servers.

```ts
const status = room.getStorageStatus();
```

### Room.reconnect

Close the room connection and try to reconnect.

```ts
room.reconnect();
```

## Storage

<Banner title="Need help troubleshooting storage?">

Try the [Liveblocks DevTools extension](/devtools) to visualize your
collaborative experiences as you build them, in real-time.

</Banner>

The room’s storage is a conflicts-free state that multiple users can edit at the
same time. It persists even after everyone leaves the room. Liveblocks provides
3 data structures that can be nested to create the state that you want.

- [`LiveObject`][] - Similar to JavaScript object. Use this for storing records
  with fixed key names and where the values don’t necessarily have the same
  types. For example, a `Person` with a `name` (string) and an `age` (number)
  field.

  If multiple clients update the same property simultaneously, the last
  modification received by the Liveblocks servers is the winner.

- [`LiveList`][] - An ordered collection of items synchronized across clients.
  Even if multiple users add/remove/move elements simultaneously, LiveList will
  solve the conflicts to ensure everyone sees the same collection of items.

- [`LiveMap`][] - Similar to a JavaScript Map. Use this for indexing values that
  all have the same structure. For example, to store an index of `Person` values
  by their name. If multiple users update the same property simultaneously, the
  last modification received by the Liveblocks servers is the winner.

### Room.getStorage

Get the room’s storage asynchronously (returns a Promise). The storage’s root is
a [`LiveObject`][].

```ts
const { root } = await room.getStorage();
```

## LiveObject

The `LiveObject` class is similar to a JavaScript object that is synchronized on
all clients. Use this for storing records with fixed key names and where the
values don’t necessarily have the same types. For example, a Person with a
`name` (string) and an `age` (number) field.

Keys should be strings, and values should be serializable to JSON.

If multiple clients update the same property simultaneously, the last
modification received by the Liveblocks servers is the winner.

### new LiveObject [#LiveObject.constructor]

Create an empty `LiveObject`

```ts
const object = new LiveObject();
```

Create a `LiveObject` with initial data.

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Margaret", lastName: "Hamilton" });
```

### delete [#LiveObject.delete]

Delete a property from the `LiveObject`

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Ada", lastName: "Lovelace" });
object.delete("lastName");

// { firstName: "Ada" }
object.toImmutable();
```

### get [#LiveObject.get]

Get a property from the `LiveObject`

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Ada", lastName: "Lovelace" });

// "Ada"
object.get("firstName");
```

### set [#LiveObject.set]

Adds or updates a property with the specified key and a value.

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Marie" });
object.set("lastName", "Curie");

// { firstName: "Marie", lastName: "Curie" }
object.toImmutable();
```

### update [#LiveObject.update]

Adds or updates multiple properties at once.

```ts
const object = new LiveObject({ job: "Scientist" });
object.update({ firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" });

// { firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper", job: "Scientist" }
object.toImmutable();
```

### toObject [#LiveObject.toObject]

<Banner title="Will be deprecated in the future">

Starting with 0.18, we recommend [`toImmutable`][] instead. It’s faster, cached,
and leads to fewer surprises.

</Banner>

Transform the `LiveObject` into a normal JavaScript object.

```ts
const liveObject = new LiveObject({ firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" });

// { firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" }
liveObject.toObject();
```

Please note that this method won’t recursively convert Live structures, which
may be surprising:

```ts
const liveObject = new LiveObject({
  animals: new LiveList(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]),
});

// { animals: <LiveList instance> } // ❗️
liveObject.toObject();
```

### toImmutable [#LiveObject.toImmutable]

Returns an immutable JavaScript object that is equivalent to the `LiveObject`.
Nested values will also be immutable.

```ts
const liveObject = new LiveObject({
  firstName: "Grace",
  lastName: "Hopper",
  hobbies: new LiveList(["reading", "piano"]),
});

// { firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper", hobbies: ["reading", "piano"] }
liveObject.toImmutable();
```

## LiveMap

The `LiveMap` class is similar to a
[JavaScript Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
that is synchronized on all clients.

Use this for indexing values that all have the same structure. For example, to
store an index of `Person` values by their name. Keys should be strings, and
values should be serializable to JSON. If multiple clients update the same
property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
servers is the winner.

### new LiveMap [#LiveMap.constructor]

Create an empty `LiveMap`.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap();
```

Create a `LiveMap` with initial data.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);
```

### delete [#LiveMap.delete]

Removes the specified element by key. Returns true if an element existed and has
been removed, or false if the element does not exist.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);

// true
map.delete("keyA");

// undefined
map.get("keyA");

// false
map.delete("unknownKey");
```

### entries [#LiveMap.entries]

Returns a new
[Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)
object that contains the `[key, value]` pairs for each element.

```ts
for (const [key, value] of map.entries()) {
  // Iterate over all the keys and values of the map
}
```

<Banner title="Iteration with TypeScript">

If your TypeScript project targets <code>es5</code> or lower, you’ll need to
enable the <code>--downlevelIteration</code> option to use this API.

</Banner>

### forEach [#LiveMap.forEach]

Executes a provided function once per each key/value pair in the Map object.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);

map.forEach((value, key) => console.log(value));
```

### get [#LiveMap.get]

Returns a specified element from the LiveMap or undefined if the key can’t be
found.

  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);

// "valueA"
map.get("keyA");

// undefined
map.get("unknownKey");
```

### has [#LiveMap.has]

Returns a boolean indicating whether an element with the specified key exists or
not.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);

// true
map.has("keyA");

// false
map.has("unknownKey");
```

### keys [#LiveMap.keys]

Returns a new
[Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)
object that contains the keys for each element.

```ts
for (const key of map.keys()) {
  // Iterate over all the keys and values of the map
}
```

<Banner title="Iteration with TypeScript">

If your TypeScript project targets <code>es5</code> or lower, you’ll need to
enable the <code>--downlevelIteration</code> option to use this API.

</Banner>

### set [#LiveMap.set]

Adds or updates an element with a specified key and a value.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap();
map.set("keyA", "valueA");

// "valueA"
map.get("keyA");
```

### size [#LiveMap.size]

Returns the number of elements in the `LiveMap`.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["keyA", "valueA"],
  ["keyB", "valueB"],
]);

// 2
map.size;
```

### values [#LiveMap.values]

Returns a new
[Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)
object that contains the the values for each element.

```ts
for (const value of map.values()) {
  // Iterate over all the values of the map
}
```

<Banner title="Iteration with TypeScript">

If your TypeScript project targets <code>es5</code> or lower, you’ll need to
enable the <code>--downlevelIteration</code> option to use this API.

</Banner>

### toImmutable [#LiveMap.toImmutable]

Returns an immutable ES6 Map that is equivalent to the `LiveMap`. Nested values
will also be immutable.

```ts
const map = new LiveMap([
  ["abc", new LiveObject({ firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" })],
  ["def", new LiveObject({ firstName: "Ada", lastName: "Lovelace" })],
]);

// Map(2) {
//   "abc" => { firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" },
//   "def" => { firstName: "Ada", lastName: "Lovelace" },
// }
map.toImmutable();
```

## LiveList

The `LiveList` class represents an ordered collection of items that is
synchronized across clients. Items should be serializable to JSON or another
Live data structure.

### new LiveList [#LiveList.constructor]

list.toImmutable();
```

### lastIndexOf [#LiveList.lastIndexOf]

Returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the `LiveList`,
or -1 if it is not present. The `LiveList` is searched backwards, starting at
fromIndex.

### push [#LiveList.push]

Adds one element to the end of the `LiveList`.

```ts
const list = new LiveList(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);

list.push("tomato");

// ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "tomato"]
list.toImmutable();
```

### set [#LiveList.set]

Replace one element at the specified index.

```ts
const list = new LiveList(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);

list.set(1, "tomato");

// ["apple", "tomato", "cherry"]
list.toImmutable();
```

### some [#LiveList.some]

Tests whether at least one element in the `LiveList` passes the test implemented
by the provided function.

```ts
const list = new LiveList(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);

// true
list.some((fruit) => fruit.startsWith("b"));

// false
list.some((fruit) => fruit.startsWith("x"));
```

### toArray [#LiveList.toArray]

<Banner title="Will be deprecated in the future">

Starting with 0.18, we recommend [`toImmutable`][] instead. It’s faster, cached,
and leads to fewer surprises.

</Banner>

Transforms the `LiveList` into a normal JavaScript array.

```ts
const list = new LiveList(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);

// ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list.toArray();
```

Please note that this method won’t recursively convert Live structures, which
may be surprising:

```ts
const list = new LiveList([
  new LiveObject({ firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" }),
]);

// [
//   <LiveObject instance>,
// ]
list.toArray();
```

### toImmutable [#LiveList.toImmutable]

Returns an immutable JavaScript array that is equivalent to the `LiveList`.
Nested values will also be immutable.

```ts
const list = new LiveList([
  new LiveObject({ firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" }),
]);

// [
//   { firstName: "Grace", lastName: "Hopper" },
// ]
list.toImmutable();
```
