## Middleware

The `liveblocks` middleware lets you connect a Zustand state to Liveblocks
Presence and Storage features.

```js highlight="2,5,9-13"
import create from "zustand";
import { liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";

const useStore = create(
  liveblocks(
    (set) => ({
      /* state and actions */
    }),
    {
      client,
      presenceMapping: {},
      storageMapping: {},
    }
  )
);
```

### client [#middleware-option-client]

See different authentication methods in the [`createClient`][] method.

```js
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";

const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
});

liveblocks(/* Zustand config */, { client })
```

### presenceMapping [#middleware-option-presence-mapping]

Mapping used to synchronize a part of your Zustand state with one Liveblocks
Room presence.

```js highlight="8"
const useStore = create(
  liveblocks(
    (set) => ({
      cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 },
    }),
    {
      client,
      presenceMapping: { cursor: true },
    }
  )
);
```

### storageMapping [#middleware-option-storage-mapping]

Mapping used to synchronize a part of your Zustand state with one Liveblocks
room storage.

```js highlight="8"
const useStore = create(
  liveblocks(
    (set) => ({
      scientist: { name: "" },
    }),
    {
      client,
      storageMapping: { scientist: true },
    }
  )
);
```

## state.liveblocks [#liveblocks-state]

Liveblocks extra state attached by the liveblocks.

### enterRoom [#liveblocks-state-enter-room]

Enters a room and starts syncing it with your Zustand state.

- `roomId`: The `id` of the room.

```js
const {
  liveblocks: { enterRoom },
} = useStore();

enterRoom("roomId");
```

If this is the first time you’re entering the room, the room is initialized from
your local Zustand state (only for the keys mentioned in your `storageMapping`
configuration).

### leaveRoom [#liveblocks-state-leave-room]

Leaves a room and stops sync it with Zustand state.

- `roomId`: The `id` of the room.

```js
const {
  liveblocks: { leaveRoom },
} = useStore();

leaveRoom("roomId");
```

### room [#liveblocks-state-room]

The [`Room`][] currently synced to your Zustand state.

```js
const {
  liveblocks: { room },
} = useStore();
```

### others [#liveblocks-state-others]

Other users in the room. Empty when no room is currently synced.

```js
const {
  liveblocks: { others },
} = useStore();
```

### isStorageLoading [#liveblocks-state-is-storage-loading]

Whether or not the room storage is currently loading.

```js
const {
  liveblocks: { isStorageLoading },
} = useStore();
```

### status [#liveblocks-state-status]

Gets the current WebSocket connection status of the room.

```js
const {
  liveblocks: { status },
} = useStore();
```

The possible value are: `initial`, `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, or
`disconnected`.

### connection (legacy) [#liveblocks-state-connection]

<Banner title="Deprecated since 1.1" type="warning">

Support for this property will be removed in a future version. We recommend
switching to the newer and simpler [`status`][] property instead.

</Banner>

Legacy connection status of the room. This property exists for backward
compatibility reasons, but it’s no longer recommended.

The value can be: `authenticating`, `connecting`, `open`, `failed`, `closed` or
`unavailable`.

```js
const {
  liveblocks: { connection },
} = useStore();
```
