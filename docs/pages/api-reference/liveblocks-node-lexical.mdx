`@liveblocks/node-lexical` provides a Node.js package to export and modify
[Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) documents on the server.

## Setup

The main entry point to modifying a document is the `withLexicalDocument`
function that returns the api used for working with Lexical documents stored in
Liveblocks. Before we can start, we must have a liveblocks node client.

```ts
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});

await withLexicalDocument(
  { roomId: "your-room-id", client: liveblocks },
  (doc: LiveblocksDocumentApi) => {
    // modify or export the document here
  }
);
```

### Returning data

You can return data from the `withLexicalDocument` closure.

```ts
const textContent = await withLexicalDocument(
  { roomId: "your-room-id", client: liveblocks },
  (doc) => doc.getTextContent()
);
```

### Custom nodes

If your lexical document has custom nodes, they must be passed into the
`withLexicalDocument` function, just like you would with a frontend lexical
client.

```ts
import { CodeNode } from "@lexical/code";
await withLexicalDocument(
  { roomId: "your-room-id", client: liveblocks, nodes: [CodeNode] },
  (api: LiveblocksDocumentApi) => {
    // modify or export the document here
  }
);
```

### Lexical Document API

#### documentApi.update

The document API provides a function similar to Lexical's `editor.update` where
it is safe to use Lexical's editor functions. These edits will be persisted and
appear in realtime to users in the room as soon as the `update` promise
resolves. Unlike Lexical's `editor.update`, this change is always discrete. The
callback can be async as well.

```ts
await withLexicalDocument(
  { client: liveblocks, roomId: ROOM_ID },
  async (doc) => {
    await doc.update(() => {
      const root = $getRoot();
      const paragraphNode = $createParagraphNode();
      const textNode = $createTextNode(asABird);
      paragraphNode.append("Hello from Liveblocks!");
      root.append(paragraphNode);
    });
  }
);
```

#### documentApi.getTextContent

Returns the text content from the root node as a `string`.

```ts
const textContent = await withLexicalDocument(
  { roomId: "your-room-id", client: liveblocks },
  (doc) => doc.getTextContent()
);
```

#### documentApi.getEditorState

Returns Lexical's [editorState](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/editor-state).

#### documentApi.getEditor

Returns a headless Lexical editor.
[@lexical/headless](https://lexical.dev/docs/packages/lexical-headless).

#### documentApi.toJSON

Returns a serailized JSON object representation of your document. See Lexical's
[Serialization & Deserialization](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/serialization)
page for more information.

```ts
const docAsJSON = await withLexicalDocument(
  { roomId: "your-room-id", client: liveblocks },
  (doc) => doc.toJson()
);
```

#### documentApi.toMarkdown

Returns a markdown `string` of your document. See Lexical's
[@lexical/markdown](https://lexical.dev/docs/concepts/serialization) page for
more information.

```ts
const markdown = await withLexicalDocument(
  { roomId: "your-room-id", client: liveblocks },
  (doc) => doc.toMarkdown()
);
```
