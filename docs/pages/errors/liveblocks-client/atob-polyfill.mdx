    "@liveblocks/client error: atob polyfill is required in your environment."

### Why this error occured

You are using `@liveblocks/client` within a JavaScript runtime which doesn't
implement [`atob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/atob).
(environments like React Native or Node < 16)

### Possible ways to fix it

As a polyfill, we recommend installing the package
[`base-64`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/base-64).

```bash
npm install base-64
```

Then you can pass the `decode` function to our `atob` polyfill option when you
create the client.

```ts highlight="1,5-7" file="src/index.js"
import { decode } from "base-64";

const client = createClient({
  /* ... your other client's options */
  polyfills: {
    atob: decode,
  },
});
```
