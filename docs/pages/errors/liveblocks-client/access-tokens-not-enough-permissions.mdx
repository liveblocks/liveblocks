### Why this error occured

Your auth endpoint issued an access token that doesn't grant enough permissions
for the requested usage (Notifications). The token grants access to only one
room which is not enough when the request is made outside a room.

### Possible ways to fix it

In your auth endpoint, when the request's room ID is undefined, you should
create a token that grants access to multiple rooms. Example:

```
session.allow("orga1*", session.FULL_ACCESS);
```
