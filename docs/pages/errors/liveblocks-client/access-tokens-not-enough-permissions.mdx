    permissions"

### Why this error occured

The client can request an access token to access resources outside a specific
room, this is the case for Notifications for example. When it happens, your auth
endpoint has to issue an access token that grants access to more than one room
using wildcards (`*`).

### Possible ways to fix it

In your auth endpoint, when the request's property `room` is undefined, you
should create a token that grants access to multiple rooms. Example:

```
session.allow("orga1*", session.FULL_ACCESS);
```
