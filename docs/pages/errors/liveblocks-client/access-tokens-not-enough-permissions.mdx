    permissions"

### Why this error occured

The client may request an access token to access resources beyond a specific room, like Notifications. In such cases, your auth endpoint should issue an access token that grants access to multiple rooms using wildcards (`*`).

### Possible ways to fix it

In your auth endpoint, when the request's property `room` is undefined, you
should create a token that grants access to multiple rooms. Example:

```
session.allow("orga1*", session.FULL_ACCESS);
```
