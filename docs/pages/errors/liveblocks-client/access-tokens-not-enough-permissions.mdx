    "@liveblocks/client error: the issued access token doesn't grant enough
    permissions"

### Why this error occured

The client may request an access token to access resources beyond a specific
room, like Notifications. In such cases, your auth endpoint should issue an
access token that grants access to multiple rooms using wildcards (`*`).

#### 1.10 warning

If you saw this warning in your auth endpoint, it's because the version 1.10
allows you to create an access token with no permission, even though it's not
recommended. When doing so, Notifications will work with an access token without
permissions, and Liveblocks will return all the user's notifications (mentions
for example) even if the user doesn't have access to the room. You should move
to use wildcards or use ID tokens, and note that this will not be allowed in
later versions.

### Possible ways to fix it

In your auth endpoint, when the request's property `room` is undefined, you
should create a token that grants access to multiple rooms. Example:

```
session.allow("orga1*", session.FULL_ACCESS);
```
