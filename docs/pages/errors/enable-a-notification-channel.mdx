## Why this error occurred

You tried to access a notification channel, such as `settings.email`, but it’s
disabled in your Liveblocks dashboard.

## How to fix it

You first need to navigate to your project in the [dashboard](/dashboard).

Then, enable a notification kind on the channel you’re trying to access. For
example, if you’re trying to access `settings.email`, navigate to the _Email_
tab and enable a notification kind.

Once a notification kind is enabled on the channel you’re accessing, the error
will disappear.
