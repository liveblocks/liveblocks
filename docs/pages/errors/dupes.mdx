## Why this error occurred

Multiple copies of some Liveblocks package ended up being bundled in your
application bundle.

This can happen because your production bundle includes two entire copies of two
different versions of Liveblocks. Or it can be the case that it includes the
same version of Liveblocks in the bundle twice because the ESM and the CJS
version got bundled separately.

It’s important that only a single copy of Liveblocks exists in your application
bundle at runtime, otherwise bugs will happen. Plus your bundle will be
unnecessarily large.

## Possible causes

- Your project is using multiple internal packages that all rely on Liveblocks,
  but maybe some are on different versions.
- Your project is using a non-standard bundler setup. If you believe this is an
  issue with the way Liveblocks is packaged, feel free to open a support
  request.

## Possible ways to fix it

To investigate your set up, run the following command to see if all your
Liveblocks dependencies are on the same version:

```bash
npm ls | grep @liveblocks
```

If they’re not all on the same version, please fix that. You could manually
upgrade that, but we recommend declaring Liveblocks as a `"peerDependency"` in
those internal packages’ `package.json` files, and only declare it in the actual
`"dependencies"` in the outermost `package.json` for your project. That way,
your package manager will keep all the versions the same.

If all your Liveblocks dependencies are on the same version already, and you’re
still seeing this error, you’re experiencing the
[dual-package hazard](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#dual-package-hazard)
problem, which means that both the ESM and the CJS version of Liveblocks end up
in your production bundle as two separate "instances". Of course, this isn’t
supposed to happen. Please let us know about this by
[opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/issues/new?template=bug_report.md),
