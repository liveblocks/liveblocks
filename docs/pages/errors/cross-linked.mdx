### Why this error occured

You’re using multiple `@liveblocks/*` packages in your application bundle, but
they’re not all on the same version.

For example: you’re using `@liveblocks/zustand` at 1.1.3, but
`@liveblocks/react` is on 1.1.4.

### How to find the culprit?

To find out if your project is affected, you can run

```bash
npm ls | grep @liveblocks
```

Please make sure that all of the versions listed there are on the same version.

### Possible ways to fix it

When you upgrade one Liveblocks package, make sure to also upgrade other
Liveblocks packages to the same version.
