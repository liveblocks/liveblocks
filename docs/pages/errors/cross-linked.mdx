## Why this error occurred

You’re using multiple `@liveblocks/*` packages in your application bundle, but
they’re not all on the same version.

For example: you’re using `@liveblocks/zustand` at 1.1.3, but
`@liveblocks/react` is on 1.1.4.

## How to find the culprit?

To find out if your project is affected, you can run

```bash
npm ls | grep @liveblocks
```

Please make sure that all of the versions listed there are on the same version.

## Possible ways to fix it

When you upgrade one Liveblocks package, make sure to also upgrade other
Liveblocks packages to the same version. The easiest way to upgrade all your
Liveblocks packages to the same version is:

- Upgrades to the latest version:
  ```bash
  npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --upgrade
  ```
- Upgrades to a specific version:
  ```bash
  npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --upgrade=3.13.3
  ```
