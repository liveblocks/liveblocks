### Why this error occured

[`RoomProvider`][] `id` property is required in order to provide a [`Room`][] in
the tree below.

### Possible ways to fix it

```jsx highlight="5"
import { RoomProvider } from "@liveblocks/react";

function Component() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider id="your-room-id" initialPresence={{}}>
      <YourComponent />
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

Sometimes, you don’t have access to your room `id` right away. For example, if
you’re using Next.js and the `id` is coming from the query string, it’s easy to
forget that `useRouter().query.roomId` returns `undefined` on the first render.
Do not render the [`RoomProvider`][] if you don’t have access to the room `id`
right away.
