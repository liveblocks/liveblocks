Follow the following steps to start configure your authentication endpoint and
start building your own security logic.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install the `liveblocks/node` package</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/node
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up authentication endpoint</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Users can only interact with rooms they have access to. You can
      configure permission access in an `api/auth` endpoint by
      creating the `auth.ts` file with the
      following code. This is where you will implement your security and
      define if the current user has access to a specific room.

      ```ts file="auth.ts"
      const express = require("express");
      const { authorize } = require("@liveblocks/node");

      const secret = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";

      const app = express();

      app.use(express.json());

      app.post("/api/auth", (req, res) => {
        /**
         * Implement your own security here.
         *
         * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
         * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
         * and that it has access to the requested room.
         */
        authorize({
          room: req.body.room,
          secret,
          userId: "123",
          groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
          userInfo: {
            // Optional, corresponds to the UserMeta[info] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
            name: "Ada Lovelace",
            color: "red",
          },
        })
          .then((authResponse) => {
            res.send(authResponse.body);
          })
          .catch((er) => {
            res.status(403).end();
          });
      });
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Set up the client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      On the front-end, you can now replace the `publicApiKey`
      option with `authEndpoint` pointing to the endpoint you
      just created.

      ```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

      const client = createClient({
        authEndpoint: "/api/auth",
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## More information

The `userId` used in the `authorize` function corresponds to `userId` used in
our APIs when setting permissions when creating a room. Both `userId` and
`userInfo` can then be used in your JavaScript application as such:

```ts
const self = room.getSelf(); // or useSelf() in React

// "123"
console.log(self.id);

// "red"
console.log(self.info.color);
```
