Follow the following steps to start configure your authentication endpoint and
start building your own security logic.

## Quickstart

<Steps

    {
      title: (
        <>
          Install the <code>@liveblocks/node</code> package
        </>
      ),
      code: {
        language: "bash",
        code: `npm install @liveblocks/node`,
      },
    },

          Users can only interact with rooms they have access to. You can
          configure permission access in an <code>api/auth</code> endpoint by
          creating the <code>auth.ts</code>
          file with the following code. This is where you will implement your security
          and define if the current user has access to a specific room.
        </>
      ),
      code: {
        file: "auth.ts",
        language: "ts",
        code: `const express = require("express");
const { authorize } = require("@liveblocks/node");
\r
const secret = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
\r
const app = express();
\r
app.use(express.json());
\r
app.post("/api/auth", (req, res) => {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  authorize({
    room: req.body.room,
    secret,
    userId: "123",
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional, corresponds to the UserMeta[info] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
      color: "red",
    },
  })
    .then((authResponse) => {
      res.send(authResponse.body);
    })
    .catch((er) => {
      res.status(403).end();
    });
});`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Setup the client",
      description: (
        <>
          On the front-end, you can now replace the <code>publicApiKey</code>{" "}
          option with <code>authEndpoint</code> pointing to the endpoint you
          just created.
        </>
      ),
      code: {
        language: "ts",
        code: `import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
\r
const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/auth",
});`,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## More information

The `userId` used in the `authorize` function corresponds to userId used in our
APIs when setting permissions (e.g. in create room). You can use the following
example to use data from `userId` and `userInfo` on the front-end.

```ts
const self = useSelf();

// "123"
console.log(self.id);

// "red"
console.log(self.info.color);
```
