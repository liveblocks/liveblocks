Follow the following steps to start configure your authentication endpoint and
start building your own security logic.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install the `liveblocks/node` package</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/node
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up authentication endpoint</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      Users can only interact with rooms they have access to. You can
      configure permission access in an `api/liveblocks-auth` endpoint by
      creating the `app/routes/api/liveblocks-auth.ts` file with the
      following code. This is where you will implement your security and
      define if the current user has access to a specific room.

      ```ts file="app/routes/api/liveblocks-auth.ts"
      import type { ActionFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
      });

      export const action: ActionFunction = async ({ req }) => {
        // You'll need to get the user from your
        // authentication provider here.
        const user = __getUserFromReq__(req);

        const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser(
          {
            userId: user.id,
            groupIds, // Optional
          },
          { userInfo: user.metadata },
        );
        return res.status(status).end(body);
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      On the front-end, you can now replace the `publicApiKey`
      option with `authEndpoint` pointing to the endpoint you
      just created.

      ```ts
      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

      const client = createClient({
        authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Set permission accesses to a room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      A room can have `defaultAccesses`, `usersAccesses`, and `groupsAccesses` defined.
      Permissions are then checked when users try to connect to a room. For security purposes,
      the [room permissions](/docs/rooms/permissions) can only be set on the back-end through a REST API.
      For instance, you can use the [create room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms)
      to create a new room with `read` public access levels while giving `write` access to specific users and groups.

      ```ts
      fetch("https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify({
          id: "roomId",
          defaultAccesses: ["room:read"],
          usersAccesses: {
            "userId": ["room:write"],
          },
          groupsAccesses: {
            "groupId": ["room:write"],
          },
        }),
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## More information

Both `userId` and `userInfo` can then be used in your React application as such:

```ts
const self = useSelf();
console.log(self.id);
console.log(self.info);
```
