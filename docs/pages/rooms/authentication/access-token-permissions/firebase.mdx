Follow the following steps to start configure your authentication endpoint and
start building your own security logic.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install the `liveblocks/node` package</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      Let’s first install the `@liveblocks/node` package in your
      Firebase functions project.
      
      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/node
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up authentication endpoint</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Create a new Firebase [callable function](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable)
      as shown below. This is where you will implement your security and
      define the rooms that the user has access to.

The client will request a token either for a specific `room`, in which case the request body property `room` will be defined, or for resources outside a specific room (like notifications), in which case, `room` will be undefined.


      See
      [permissions with access token](/docs/rooms/permissions/access-token)
      to understand how to grant access to multiple rooms with an access token.


      ```js
      const functions = require("firebase-functions");
      const { Liveblocks } = require("@liveblocks/node");

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
      });

      exports.auth = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
        // Get the current user from your database
        const user = __getUserFromDB__(data);

        // Start an auth session inside your endpoint
        const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
          user.id,
          { userInfo: user.metadata },  // Optional
        );

        // Implement your own security, and give the user access to the room/organization.
        // Note: Even if room is defined, you could choose to always use wildcards.
        const { room } = request.body;
        if (room && __shouldUserHaveAccess__(user, room)) {
          session.allow(room, session.FULL_ACCESS);
        }
        else {
          session.allow(`${user.organization}*`, session.READ_ACCESS)
        }

        // Authorize the user and return the result
        const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
        return JSON.parse(body);
      });
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Set up the client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      On the front end, you can now replace the `publicApiKey`
      option with `authEndpoint` pointing to the endpoint you
      just created.

      ```js
      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
      import firebase from "firebase";
      import "firebase/functions";

      firebase.initializeApp({
        /* Firebase config */
      });

      const auth = firebase.functions().httpsCallable("liveblocks-auth");

      // Create a Liveblocks client
      const client = createClient({
        authEndpoint: async (room) => (await auth({ room })).data,
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## More information

Both `userId` and `userInfo` can then be used in your JavaScript application as
such:

```ts
const self = room.getSelf(); // or useSelf() in React
console.log(self.id);
console.log(self.info);
```
