Follow the following steps to start configure your authentication endpoint and
start building your own security logic.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install the `liveblocks/node` package</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/node
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up authentication endpoint</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      Users can only interact with rooms they have access to. You can
      configure permission access in an `api/liveblocks-auth` endpoint by
      creating the `src/routes/api/liveblocks-auth/+server.ts` file with the
      following code. This is where you will implement your security and
      define if the current user has access to a specific room.

      ```ts file="src/routes/api/auth/+server.ts"
      import { type RequestEvent } from "@sveltejs/kit";
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
      });

      export async function POST({ req }: RequestEvent) {
        // You'll need to get the user from your
        // authentication provider here.
        const user = __getUserFromReq__(req);

        const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
          user.id,
          { userInfo: user.metadata },  // Optional
        );
        // You'll need to implement your own security here.
        if (req.body.room && __checkHasAccess__(user, req.body.room)) {
          session.allow(req.body.room, session.FULL_ACCESS);
        }

        const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
        return res.status(status).end(body);
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Set up the client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      On the front-end, you can now replace the `publicApiKey`
      option with `authEndpoint` pointing to the endpoint you
      just created.

      ```ts
      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

      const client = createClient({
        authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## More information

Both `userId` and `userInfo` can then be used in your Svelte application as
such:

```ts
const self = room.getSelf();
console.log(self.id);
console.log(self.info.color);
```
