Follow the following steps to start configure your authentication endpoint and
start building your own security logic in Next.js’ `/app` directory.

## Quickstart

          Install the <code>@liveblocks/node</code> package

          Users can only interact with rooms they have access to. You can
          configure permission access in an <code>api/auth</code> endpoint by
          creating the <code>app/api/auth/route.ts</code> file with the
          following code. This is where you will implement your security and
          define if the current user has access to a specific room.
        </>
      ),
      code: {
        file: "app/api/auth/route.ts",
        language: "ts",
        code: `import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { authorize } from "@liveblocks/node";
\r
const secret = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
\r
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  const { room } = await request.json();
  const result = await authorize({
    room,
    secret,
    userId: "123",
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional, corresponds to the UserMeta[info] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
      color: "red",
    },
  });
\r
  return NextResponse.json(JSON.parse(result.body));
}`,
      },
    },
    {

          On the front-end, you can now replace the <code>publicApiKey</code>{" "}
          option with <code>authEndpoint</code> pointing to the endpoint you
          just created.
        </>
      ),
      code: {
        language: "ts",
        code: `import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
\r
const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/auth",
});`,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## More information

The `userId` used in the `authorize` function corresponds to userId used in our
APIs when setting permissions (e.g. in create room). You can use the following
example to use data from `userId` and `userInfo` on the front-end.

```ts
const self = useSelf();

// "123"
console.log(self.id);

// "red"
console.log(self.info.color);
```
