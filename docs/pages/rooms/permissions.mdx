By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication endpoint
where everyone automatically has access to rooms. This approach is great for
prototyping and marketing pages where setting up your own security isn’t always
required. If you want to limit access to a room for certain users, you’ll need
to [set up an authentication endpoint](/docs/rooms/authentication) to enable
permissions.

There are ways to set up authentication with Liveblocks. You can either through
access token permissions where a global access token is generated with accesses
are directly embedded in that token, or through fine grained ID token
permissions at the room level where users get verified every time they enter the
room.
