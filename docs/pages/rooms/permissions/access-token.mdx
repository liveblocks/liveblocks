Managing permissions by issuing access tokens follows the analogy of a “hotel
room key card”. Anyone that has that key card can open the doors that the card
gives access to. It’s easy to give out those key cards right from your back
end.

<Banner title="Using our REST API?">

If you’re using our REST API to handle room permissions, or if you need more
complex permissions to be handled by Liveblocks,
[ID tokens](/docs/rooms/permissions/id-token) may be better suited for your use
case.

To set up your authentication endpoint with access token permissions, make sure
to [follow these quick steps](/docs/rooms/authentication/id-token-permissions).

## Authentication patterns [#patterns]

### Full access to just one room

```ts
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Get the current user from your database
  const user = __getUserFromDB__(request);

  // Start an auth session inside your endpoint
  const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
    user.id,
    { userInfo: user.metadata } // Optional
  );

  // Implement your own security, and give the user access to the room
  const { room } = await request.json();
  if (room && __shouldUserHaveAccess__(user, room)) {
    session.allow(room, session.FULL_ACCESS);
  }

  // Authorize the user and return the result
  const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

### Full access to all rooms from a team

To be able to use this pattern, you will have to name your rooms using a fixed
pattern of `<team>:<room>`. For suggestions, read more on our
[naming best practices](#naming-best-practices).

```ts
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const user = __getUserFromDB__(request);

  const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(user.id, {
    userInfo: user.metadata,
  });

  // Implement your own security, and give the user access to the room
  const { room } = await request.json();
  if (room && __shouldUserHaveAccess__(user, room)) {
    // Suppose this application organizes their Liveblocks rooms by keys
    // structured like `<team>:<room>`.
    // We can then use the passed-in requested room to infer which team to
    // check membership for.
    const [team, _] = room.split(":");
    if (__isMemberOfTeam__(user, team)) {
      // If the user is a member of this team, don't just grant full access to
      // the request room, but to _all_ of the team's rooms, using a prefix
      // pattern.
      session.allow(`${team}:*`, session.FULL_ACCESS);
    }
    session.allow(room, session.FULL_ACCESS);
  }

  const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

### Full access to all rooms from a team, but read-only access to rooms from the organization level

To be able to use this pattern, you will have to name your rooms using a fixed
pattern of `<org>:<team>:<room>`. For suggestions, read more on our
[naming best practices](#naming-best-practices).

```ts
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const user = __getUserFromDB__(request);

  const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(user.id, {
    userInfo: user.metadata,
  });

  const { room } = await request.json();
  if (room && __shouldUserHaveAccess__(user, room)) {
    // Suppose this application organizes their Liveblocks rooms by keys
    // structured like `<org>:<team>:<room>`.
    // We can then use the passed-in requested room to infer which team to
    // check membership for.
    const [org, team, _] = room.split(":");
    if (__isMemberOfOrg__(user, org)) {
      session.allow(`${org}:*`, session.READ_ACCESS);
    }
    if (__isMemberOfTeam__(user, team)) {
      session.allow(`${org}:${team}:*`, session.FULL_ACCESS);
    }
  }

  const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

## Best practices for naming your rooms [#naming-best-practices]

Being able to specify permissions for infinite rooms using prefix pattern
matching offers great powers, but it does assume that you design your room names
a bit more cautiously. For example, granting room prefix permissions won’t work
if you use random room IDs for your project, because there won’t be a shared
prefix.

Therefore, if you want to adopt this pattern, we recommend designing your room
names hierarchically in namespaced “buckets” in a way that makes sense for your
app.

For example, if your app manages documents by team, each room could be named
using a `<team-id>:<room-id>` pattern:

For example:

- `"engineering:R5AhJlTSKwBR"`
- `"engineering:PqY3oqRcV-7Z"`
- `"marketing:SVUPHaboSc10"`
- `"marketing:Y7Uyw44YRxjY"`

<Banner title="Punctuation doesn't matter">
  Please note that the `:` separator used here carries no specific meaning. You
  can use any separator you like. Just make sure the separator character you
  pick cannot occur in the IDs you’re generating.
</Banner>

As another example, if your app is a SAAS product, and you have many customers,
you can add an additional top-level key to prefix your room names, e.g.
`<app-id>::<group-id>/<room-id>`:

Example room IDs:

- `"jOzGLFEAedV5::engineering/R5AhJlTSKwBR"`
- `"jOzGLFEAedV5::engineering/PqY3oqRcV-7Z"`
- `"rGSoepTL7r-Y::marketing/SVUPHaboSc10"`
- `"rGSoepTL7r-Y::marketing/Y7Uyw44YRxjY"`

Again, the `::` and `/` separators here are used for illustrative purposes. You
can use any separator you want.

  If you have existing rooms that aren't created with this naming scheme in
  mind, it may be hard to change them. We currently don't offer a REST API to
  rename your rooms (yet). If you need assistance with renaming your rooms, our
