Managing permissions by issuing ID (identity) tokens follows the analogy of
issuing “membership cards”. Anyone with such membership card can try to enter a
room, but your permissions will be checked at the door, every time you try to
enter a room. This approach to permissions is powerful but can be hard to
manage, because you will have to make sure all the access information is entered
into our system and kept up to date.

Rooms can have different permission types assigned at three different levels:
default, groups, and users. The system is flexible enough to enable you to build
a permission system that fits your needs. With that, you can build invite flows
that drive more people to your product.

<Banner title="Don’t need complex permissions?">
  If you’d like a simpler approach, and don’t need fine-grained permissions set
  with our REST API, we recommend using [access
  tokens](/docs/rooms/permissions/access-token) instead.
</Banner>

To set up your authentication endpoint to issue ID tokens, make sure to follow
the steps for your framework in our
[ID token authentication guides](/docs/rooms/authentication/id-token-permissions).

## Types [#permissions-types]

Different permission types can be applied:

<dl>
  <dt>`room:write`</dt>
  <dd>
    Full access. Enables people to view and edit the room. `isReadOnly` is
    `false`.
  </dd>
  <dt>`room:read` + `room:presence:write`</dt>
  <dd>
    Read access with presence. Enables people to edit their presence, but only
    view the room&rsquo;s storage. `isReadOnly` is `true`.
  </dd>
</dl>

### Read-only access

To check if a user only has read-only access to storage in your app, the
`isReadOnly` boolean can be retrieved from
[`others`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Room.getOthers) or
[`self`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Room).

```ts
// Vanilla
const { isReadOnly } = room.getSelf();

// React
const selfIsReadOnly = useSelf((me) => me.isReadOnly);
```

You can also use our APIs to access this information, as well as set it, as
we’ll detail below.

## Levels [#permissions-levels]

Permission types can be applied at three different levels:

<dl>
  <dt>defaultAccesses</dt>
  <dd>The default permission types to apply to the entire room.</dd>
  <dt>groupsAccesses</dt>
  <dd>Permission types to apply to specific groups of users.</dd>
  <dt>usersAccesses</dt>
  <dd>Permission types to apply to specific users.</dd>
</dl>

Each level further down will override access levels defined above, for example a
room with private access will allow a user with `room:write` access to enter.

## Default [#permissions-levels-default-accesses]

The `defaultAccesses` level is used to set the default permissions of the entire
room.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-access-denied.png"
    alt="Access denied illustration"
    width={820}
    height={412}
  />
</Figure>

When used in our APIs, this property takes an array, with an empty array `[]`
signifying no access. Add permission types to this array to define the default
access level to your room.

```ts
// private - no one has access by default
"defaultAccesses": []

// public - everyone can edit and view the room
"defaultAccesses": ["room:write"]

// read-only - everyone can view the room, but only presence can be edited
"defaultAccesses": ["room:read", "room:presence:write"]
```

## Setting room access [#permissions-levels-default-accesses-example]

We can use the
[create room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms) to create a
new room with public access levels:

```ts highlight="5"
fetch("https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: "my-public-room",
    defaultAccesses: ["room:write"],
  }),
});
```

The default permission types can later be modified with the
[update room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId), in
this example turning the room private:

```ts highlight="6"
const roomId = "my-room-name";

fetch(`https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/${roomId}`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    defaultAccesses: [],
  }),
});
```

Default accesses can be also be used within a number of our
[other APIs](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints).

## Groups [#permissions-levels-groups-accesses]

The `groupsAccesses` level is used to set the default permissions of any given
group within room.

    <source src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-groups.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

Groups are represented by a `groupId`—a custom string that represents a
selection of users in your app. Groups can be attached to a user by passing an
array of `groupId` values in `groupIds`, during
[authentication](/docs/rooms/authentication/id-token-permissions).

```js highlight="10"
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
    userId: "marie@example.com",
    groupIds: ["engineering"]
  });

  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

In our APIs you can then set group accesses by using the `groupId` as the key,
and an array of permissions as the value.

```ts
// "engineering" group has access to view and edit
"groupsAccesses": {
  "engineering": ["room:write"],
}
```

### Modifying group access [#permissions-levels-groups-accesses-example]

To allow an "engineering" group access to view a room, and modify their
presence, we can use the
[update room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId) with
`engineering` as a `groupId`:

```ts highlight="7"
const roomId = "my-room-name";

fetch(`https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/${roomId}`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    groupsAccesses: {
      engineering: ["room:read", "room:presence:write"],
    },
  }),
});
```

To remove a group’s permissions, we can use the
[update room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId)
again, and set the permission type to `null`:

```ts highlight="7"
const roomId = "my-room-name";

fetch(`https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/${roomId}`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    groupsAccesses: {
      engineering: null,
    },
  }),
});
```

Group accesses can be also be used within a number of our
[other APIs](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints).

## Users [#permissions-levels-users-accesses]

The `usersAccesses` level is used to set permissions of any give user within a
room.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-share-dialog.png"
    alt="Share dialog illustration"
    width={820}
    height={412}
  />
</Figure>

To use this, first a user is given a `userId` during
[authentication](/docs/rooms/authentication).

```js highlight="9"
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
    userId: "ellen@acme.inc"
  });

  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

Then, if you want the user with the `userId` id to make edits, set `userId` to
`["room:write"]` within `usersAccesses` when creating or updating a room.

```ts
// user with userId "ellen@acme.inc" has access to view and edit
"usersAccesses": {
  "ellen@acme.inc": ["room:write"]
}
```

### Checking user access [#permissions-levels-users-accesses-example]

To create an invitation system, we can use the
[update room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId) and
use an email address as a `userId`:

```ts highlight="7"
const roomId = "my-room-name";

fetch(`https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/${roomId}`, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    usersAccesses: {
      "ellen@acme.inc": ["room:write"],
    },
  }),
});
```

To check a user’s assigned permission types for this room, we can then use the
[get room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId) and
check `usersAccesses`:

```ts
const roomId = "my-room-name";
const url = `https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/${roomId}`;
const response = await fetch(url);
const room = await response.json();

// { "ellen@acme.inc": ["room:write"] }
console.log(room.data.usersAccesses);
```

User accesses can be also be used within a number of our
[other APIs](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints).
