You can assign custom `metadata` to your room. For example, if you have
different types of room experiences, you can store that type as `metadata`. This
would then come handy when building an overview page listing all the rooms where
the type `metadata` could be used as a filter, making it easy for people to find
what they’re looking for.

One way to edit `metadata` is to use the
[create room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms). In this
example we’re creating a new room with a custom `roomType` property, and setting
it to "whiteboard":

```ts highlight="7"
fetch("https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: "my-room-name",
    defaultAccesses: [],
    metadata: {
      roomType: "whiteboard",
    },
  }),
});
```

We can then use the
[get rooms API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms) to retrieve a
list of rooms containing the "whiteboard" `roomType`:

```ts
const metadata = "metadata.roomType=whiteboard";
const url = `https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms?${metadata}`;
const response = await fetch(url);
const rooms = await response.json();
```

Metadata can be also be used within a number of our
[other APIs](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints).
