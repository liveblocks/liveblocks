Liveblocks is the collaboration layer for your product. It provides the
architecture, realtime backend, and ready-made features that let humans and AI
collaborate inside your app—both in real time and asynchronously. Think of
Liveblocks as the collaboration architecture your product never had.

This page introduces the core concepts behind Liveblocks so you understand how
everything fits together.

## What is Liveblocks?

Liveblocks is built on a small set of foundational concepts:

| Concept             | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Projects            | Top-level container for your application                                                  |
| Tenants             | Compartmentalize rooms and notifications per organization                                 |
| Rooms               | Spaces in your product where collaboration happens                                        |
| Collaborators       | People (users) and AI agents doing work together                                          |
| Ready-made features | Collaboration building blocks like Comments, Multiplayer, Notifications, and AI Agents    |
| Platform            | The realtime backend, admin dashboard, and SDKs that make collaboration possible at scale |

These concepts work together to let people and AI collaborate inside your app,
without changing your existing authentication, backend, or data model.

## Projects

A project is the top-level container in your Liveblocks team workspace that
usually maps to an application. Each project includes:

- API keys
- Rooms
- AI Agents
- Usage metrics
- Event logs
- Webhook settings
- Notification settings
- Region and environment settings

### Regions

When creating a project, you can choose to locate it in one of the following
regions:

| Region | Data hosted                                           | Availability                |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Earth  | Globally on Cloudflare edge servers and AWS us‑east‑1 | All plans                   |
| US     | US only with Cloudflare FedRAMP and AWS us‑east‑1     | [Enterprise plan](/pricing) |
| EU     | EU only with Cloudflare EU and AWS eu‑central‑1       | [Enterprise plan](/pricing) |

### Environments

You can also assign one of the following environment tags to a project:

| Environment | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Development | For development, testing, and prototyping |
| Production  | For production                            |

Teams typically create separate projects for production, staging, and
development. Encrypted keys and higher limits apply to production environment
projects.

## Tenants

Tenants allow you to compartmentalize Liveblocks resources, such as inbox
notifications, rooms, and everything associated with rooms such as comment
threads, realtime data stored, and more. Each tenant represents a separate
organization or customer in your system, meaning you can easily add a
workspace/org switcher to your application, with each workspace having its own
notification inbox.

## Rooms

A room is the space where people and AI collaborate together. Inside a room, you
can enable:

- presence (who’s online, live cursors, live selections)
- shared state for multiplayer interactions
- contextual comment threads
- @ mentions and actions that trigger notifications

Rooms typically map to artifacts people and AI can create inside your product,
such as:

- a text document
- a workflow diagram
- a spreadsheet
- a whiteboard
- a form builder
- a 3D file
- a video editor
- a design file
- a presentation

## Collaborators

Collaborators are the entities that do work together. You bring them —
Liveblocks provides the environment and capabilities they use to collaborate.

### Users

Users are the authenticated people using your application. You keep ownership of
the authentication system, Liveblocks only needs a user ID.

Users can:

- view and edit content
- see presence and activity
- leave contextual comments
- @ mention users, groups, and AI agents
- receive notifications

### AI Agents

AI agents are AI-driven collaborators that can act inside your product.

Liveblocks supports two types of agents:

- Liveblocks AI Copilots
- Framework agents (n8n, LangChain, etc.)

#### Liveblocks AI Copilots

Configured directly in the dashboard. Ideal for chatbot-style assistive
behavior.

- Works with any LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or custom)
- Supports knowledge RAG from PDFs, images, websites, and text
- Fully compatible with the `<AiChat />` component
- Acts on behalf of a user to take actions inside your app
- Accessed through chat (not via @ mentions)

#### Framework agents

Use external agents powered by your own infrastructure or tools like n8n,
LangChain, Crew AI, and more. Framework agents behave like true collaborators:

- They appear in rooms with presence
- Users can @mention them in comments or text documents
- Room events (mentions, edits, messages) are sent to your webhook endpoint
- Your agent returns actions that update UI, create comments, or drive workflows

## Ready-made features

Liveblocks includes a set of collaboration building blocks you can use
individually or together.

### AI Agents

Let AI collaborate with your users. Agents can chat, respond to mentions, take
actions, or help users complete tasks.

### Comments

Threaded, contextual discussions attached to any part of your UI.

- Threads and replies
- @ mentions
- Reactions and metadata
- Attachments
- Fully customizable React components

### Notifications

Keep users informed about collaboration happening in rooms. Notifications can be
triggered by:

- comments and mentions
- AI agent actions
- multiplayer activity
- custom events from your backend

They can be delivered via different channels:

- in-app inbox
- email
- Slack (via webhook)
- Microsoft Teams (via webhook)
- Web Push (via webhook)

### Multiplayer

Realtime collaboration primitives built on conflict-free sync.

- presence (avatar stacks, live cursors, live selections)
- shared persisted state
- multiplayer undo/redo
- version history

Under the hood, multiplayer relies on sync engines:

- Liveblocks Storage - a built-in CRDT engine designed for ease of use,
  performance, and interoperability with Liveblocks features.
- Yjs - an open-source CRDT engine designed for text editors like Notion and
  Google Docs.

## Platform

The Liveblocks Platform powers collaboration at runtime. It includes:

- Realtime backend
  - WebSocket infrastructure
  - Presence and connection management
  - Low-latency messaging
  - Room orchestration
- Async pipelines
  - Notification delivery
  - Webhooks
  - Event batching and grouping
- Admin dashboard
  - Usage and monitoring
  - Project and API keys management
  - Webhook management
  - Notification channel management
  - Hosting regions
  - Event logs
- DevTools browser extension
- SDKs and packages
