Liveblocks is the collaboration layer for your product. It provides the
architecture, realtime backend, and ready-made features that let humans and AI
collaborate inside your app—both in realtime and asynchronously. Think of
Liveblocks as the collaboration architecture your product never had. This page
introduces the core concepts behind Liveblocks so you understand how everything
fits together.

## What is Liveblocks?

Liveblocks is the collaboration layer for your product. It’s built on a small
set of foundational concepts list below. These concepts work together to let
people and AI collaborate inside your app, without changing your existing
authentication, backend, or data model.

| Concept             | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Projects            | Top-level container for your application                                                  |
| Tenants             | Compartmentalize rooms and notifications per organization                                 |
| Rooms               | Spaces in your product where collaboration happens                                        |
| Collaborators       | People (users) and AI agents doing work together                                          |
| Ready-made features | Collaboration building blocks like Comments, Multiplayer, Notifications, and AI Agents    |
| Platform            | The realtime backend, admin dashboard, and SDKs that make collaboration possible at scale |

## Projects

A project is the top-level container in your Liveblocks team workspace that
usually maps to an application. Each project includes things like API keys,
rooms, AI agents, usage metrics, event logs, webhook settings, notification
settings, region and environment settings, and more.

### Regions

You can choose to locate a project in one of the following regions. The region
cannot be changed once the project has been created.

| Region | Data hosted                                           | Availability                |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Earth  | Globally on Cloudflare edge servers and AWS us‑east‑1 | All plans                   |
| US     | US only with Cloudflare FedRAMP and AWS us‑east‑1     | [Enterprise plan](/pricing) |
| EU     | EU only with Cloudflare EU and AWS eu‑central‑1       | [Enterprise plan](/pricing) |

### Environments

You can assign one of the following environment tags to a project. The
environment tag cannot be changed once the project has been created. Teams
typically create separate projects for production, staging, and development.
Encrypted keys and higher limits apply to production environment projects.

| Environment | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Development | For development, testing, and prototyping |
| Production  | For production                            |

## Tenants

Tenants allow you to compartmentalize Liveblocks resources, such as inbox
notifications, rooms, and everything associated with rooms such as comment
threads, realtime data stored, and more. Each tenant represents a separate
organization or customer in your system, meaning you can easily add a
workspace/org switcher to your application, with each workspace having its own
notification inbox. Each project can have multiple tenants, though only one is
required.

## Rooms

A room is the space where people and AI collaborate together. Inside a room, you
can enable things like presence, shared state for multiplayer interactions,
contextual comment threads, @ mentions and actions that trigger notifications.

</Figure>

Rooms typically map to artifacts people and AI can create inside your product,
such as text documents, workflow diagrams, spreadsheets, whiteboards, forms, 3D
files, video editors, design files, presentations, and more.

## Ready-made features

Liveblocks includes a set of collaboration building blocks you can use
individually or together. These ready-made features provide pre-built
components, hooks, and APIs that handle the complexity of realtime
collaboration, allowing you to focus on building your product’s unique
experience.

## Collaborators

Collaborators are the entities that do work together in your application.
Liveblocks provides the infrastructure and ready-made features they use to
collaborate. There are two types of collaborators: users (people) and AI agents.

### Users

Users are the authenticated people using your application. Liveblocks only needs
a `userId` to identify them. Users can:

- View and edit content.
- See presence and activity.
- Leave contextual comments.
- @ mention users, groups, and AI agents.
- Receive notifications.

### AI Agents

AI agents are AI-driven collaborators that can act inside your product.
Liveblocks supports two types of agents: Liveblocks AI Copilots and framework
agents (private beta).

#### Liveblocks AI Copilots

Configured directly in the dashboard. Ideal for chatbot-style assistive
behavior.

- Works with any LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or custom).
- Supports RAG knowledge from PDFs, images, websites, and text.
- Fully compatible with the
  [`<AiChat />`](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-agents/liveblocks-ai-copilots/default-components#AiChat)
  component.
- Acts on behalf of a user to take actions inside your app.
- Accessed through chat (not via @ mentions).

#### Framework agents (private beta)

Use external agents powered by your own infrastructure or tools like
[n8n](https://n8n.io/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/),
[Crew AI](https://crewai.com/), and more. Framework agents behave like true
collaborators.

- They appear in rooms with presence.
- Users can @mention them in comments or text documents.
- Room events (mentions, edits, messages) are sent to your webhook endpoint.
- Your agent returns actions that update UI, create comments, or drive
  workflows.

<Banner type="info" title="Private beta">

Framework agents are currently in private beta. If you would like access to the
beta, please [contact us](https://liveblocks.io/contact/sales). We’d love to
hear from you.

## Platform

The Liveblocks Platform powers collaboration at runtime through a realtime back
end, using WebSocket infrastructure to handle presence, connection management,
low-latency messaging, and room orchestration. Async pipelines manage
notification delivery, webhooks, and event batching and grouping. An admin
dashboard provides usage and monitoring, project and API keys management,
webhook management, notification channel management, hosting regions, and event
logs. The platform also includes a
[DevTools browser extension](/docs/platform/devtools) and a comprehensive set of
SDKs and packages.
