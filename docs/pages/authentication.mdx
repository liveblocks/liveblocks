Liveblocks provides different methods to authenticate your application using
your public and secret API keys. For any production application, you should use
your secret key to enable access token or ID token authentication. These methods
can be used to control access to your rooms and data.

<Banner title="Public key is for prototyping" type="warning">

We don’t recommend using your public API key in production, as it’s difficult
for us to accurately measure your MCUs without any user information. We
recommend using your secret key instead, see below.

## Authentication methods

Secret key authentication in Liveblocks relies on generating JSON Web Tokens
(JWTs), and then passing these to your client. There are different ways to do
this, and it may depend on your framework, but first, it’s important to learn
the difference between _access tokens_ and _ID tokens_.

### Access tokens

[Access token](/docs/authentication/access-token) authentication allows you to
handle permissions yourself. When a user authenticates, it’s up to you to tell
Liveblocks which rooms they should be allowed inside. This means that you need
to manually keep track of which users should be allowed in which rooms, and
apply these permissions yourself each time a user connects.

In the diagram above, you can see an access token is allowing “Olivier” into the
“my-team/sf8s7f9sf7s9f6s” room.

### ID tokens

[ID tokens](/docs/authentication/id-token) authentication allows Liveblocks to
handle permissions for you. This means that when you create or modify a room,
you can set a user’s permissions on the room itself, this acting as a source of
truth. Later, when a user tries to enter a room, Liveblocks will automatically
check if the user has permission, and deny them access if the permissions aren’t
set.

In the diagram above, a room is created giving “Alicia” permission to enter.
Later, when “Alicia” authenticates, her identity is confirmed, and when she
tries to enter a room, her permissions are then checked.
