For production applications, we recommend using your secret API key to
authenticate users with **ID tokens**. Your public API key is only for
prototyping and public applications.

## How ID token authentication works

ID token authentication allows Liveblocks to handle permissions for you. This
means that when you create or modify a room, you can set a user’s permissions on
the room itself. This means the room acts as a source of truth. Later, when a
user tries to enter a room, Liveblocks will automatically check if the user has
permission, and deny them access if the permissions aren’t set.

Permissions aren’t just for individual users, but can also be set for groups of
users, or for the whole room at once.

<Banner title="You prefer to handle permissions yourself?">

If you don’t need fine-grained permissions, or if you’d prefer storing
individual room permissions in your own system, you can use
[access tokens](/docs/authentication/access-token) instead.

</Banner>

## Authenticating

Authenticating with ID tokens means creating a
[JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) (JWT) that’s used
to verify the identity of the current user when connecting to a Liveblocks room.
This token is created using
[`liveblocks.identifyUser`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#id-tokens) or
[`/identify-user`](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-identify-user).

```ts
const { body, status } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
  userId: "olivier@example.com",
});

// '{ token: "eyJga7..." }'
console.log(body);
```

## Workspace permissions [#permissions]

Using [tenants](/docs/authentication/tenants), you can create workspaces in your
application, compartmentalizing all resources such as inbox notifications and
rooms. This includes everything associated with rooms such as comment threads,
realtime data stored, and more. This allows you to add a workspace switcher to
your application, separating each of your customers/organizations.

  <Image
    src="/assets/authentication/org-switcher.png"
    alt="A workspace switcher"
    width={1600}
    height={1000}
    quality={90}
  />
</Figure>

### Set up workspace permissions

To set up workspace permissions, pass a `tenantId` when authenticating a user,
ensuring that the user will only have access to resources within this workspace.

```ts
const { body, status } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
  userId: "olivier@example.com",
  // +++
  tenantId: "my-tenant-id",
  // +++
});

// '{ token: "eyJga7..." }'
console.log(body);
```

When creating a resource on the server, such as a room, pass the `tenantId` to
the resource, to allow the user access.

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("my-room-id", {
  defaultAccesses: ["room:write"],
  // +++
  tenantId: "my-tenant-id",
  // +++
});

// { type: "room", id: "my-room-id", metadata: {...}, ... }
console.log(room);
```

## Room permissions

ID token authentication allows you to set different permission types on rooms,
assigned at three different levels: default, groups, and users. The system is
flexible enough to enable you to build a permission system that’s helpful for
building invite dialogs, private rooms, and more.

<Figure>
  <img
    src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-share-dialog.png"
    alt="Share dialog illustration"
  />
</Figure>

To set room permissions, you can
[create](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms) or
[update](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId) a room, passing
permission information in the options.

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  // This is a private room
  defaultAccesses: [],

  // But Olivier can enter
  usersAccesses: {
    "olivier@example.com": ["room:read"],
  },
});
```

### Permission types [#permission-types]

There are three permission values that you can set on rooms.

<dl>
  <dt>`["room:write"]`</dt>
  <dd>
    Full access. Enables people to view and edit the room. On the client,
    [`canWrite`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#Checking-user-permissions)
    is `true`.
  </dd>
  <dt>`["room:read", "room:presence:write"]`</dt>
  <dd>
    Read access with presence. Enables people to edit their presence, but only
    view the room&rsquo;s storage. On the client,
    [`canWrite`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#Checking-user-permissions)
    is `false`.
  </dd>
  <dt>`["room:read", "room:presence:write", "comments:write"]`</dt>
  <dd>
    Read access with presence and comments. Enables people to edit their
    presence, view the room&rsquo;s storage, and comment on the document. On the
    client,
    [`canWrite`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#Checking-user-permissions)
    is `false`.
  </dd>
  <dt>`[]`</dt>
  <dd>Private. No one can enter the room.</dd>
</dl>

### Permission levels [#permission-types]

Permission types can be applied at three different levels, enabling complex
entry systems.

<dl>
  <dt>defaultAccesses</dt>
  <dd>The default permission types to apply to the entire room.</dd>
  <dt>groupsAccesses</dt>
  <dd>Permission types to apply to specific groups of users.</dd>
  <dt>usersAccesses</dt>
  <dd>Permission types to apply to specific users.</dd>
</dl>

Each level further down will override access levels defined above, for example a
room with private access will allow a user with `room:write` access to enter.

### Default room permissions

The `defaultAccesses` level is used to set the default permissions of the entire
room.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-access-denied.png"
    alt="Access denied illustration"
    width={820}
    height={412}
  />
</Figure>

When used in our APIs, this property takes an array, with an empty array `[]`
signifying no access. Add permission types to this array to define the default
access level to your room.

```ts
// Private - no one has access by default
"defaultAccesses": []

// Public - everyone can edit and view the room
"defaultAccesses": ["room:write"]

// Read-only - everyone can view the room, but only presence can be edited
"defaultAccesses": ["room:read", "room:presence:write"]
```

#### Setting room access

We can use the
[`liveblocks.createRoom`](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms) to
create a new room with public access levels:

```ts highlight="2"
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  defaultAccesses: ["room:write"],
});
```

The default permission types can later be modified with
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId),
in this example turning the room private:

```ts highlight="2"
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  defaultAccesses: [],
});
```

### Groups permissions

The `groupsAccesses` level is used to set the default permissions of any given
group within room.

<Figure>
  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-groups.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

Groups are represented by a `groupId`—a custom string that represents a
selection of users in your app. Groups can be attached to a user by passing an
array of `groupId` values in `groupIds`, during authentication.

```js highlight="10"
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
    userId: "marie@example.com",
    groupIds: ["engineering"],
  });

  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

In our APIs you can then set group accesses by using the `groupId` as the key,
and an array of permissions as the value.

```ts
// "engineering" group has access to view and edit
"groupsAccesses": {
  "engineering": ["room:write"],
}
```

#### Modifying group access [#permissions-levels-groups-accesses-example]

To allow an “engineering” group access to view a room, and modify their
presence, we can use
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId)
with `engineering` as a `groupId`:

```ts highlight="3"
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  groupsAccesses: {
    engineering: ["room:read", "room:presence:write"],
  },
});
```

After calling this, every user in the “engineering” group will have read-only
access. To remove a group’s permissions, we can use
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId)
again, and set the permission type to `null`:

```ts highlight="7"
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  groupsAccesses: {
    engineering: null,
  },
});
```

### User permissions

The `usersAccesses` level is used to set permissions of any given user within a
room.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-share-dialog.png"
    alt="Share dialog illustration"
    width={820}
    height={412}
  />
</Figure>

To use this, first a user is given a `userId` during authentication.

```js highlight="9"
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
    userId: "ellen@acme.inc",
  });

  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

Then, if you want the user with the `userId` id to make edits, set `userId` to
`["room:write"]` within `usersAccesses` when creating or updating a room.

```ts
// user with userId "ellen@acme.inc" has access to view and edit
"usersAccesses": {
  "ellen@acme.inc": ["room:write"]
}
```

#### Checking user access [#permissions-levels-users-accesses-example]

To give them room permission, we can use
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId),
setting write access on their `userId`:

```ts highlight="3"
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  usersAccesses: {
    "ellen@acme.inc": ["room:write"],
  },
});
```

To check a user’s assigned permission types for this room, we can then use
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms-roomId)
and check `usersAccesses`:

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.getRoom("a32wQXid4A9");

// { "ellen@acme.inc": ["room:write"] }
console.log(room.data.usersAccesses);
```

## A concrete example

We will setup ID token authentication for an application that uses tenants and
has users with different roles.

### Roles

We will use the following roles:

- `admin` - can do everything
- `commenter` - can comment on the document
- `viewer` - can only view the document

#### Permissions

We will use the following permissions:

- `room:write` - full access to the room
- `room:read` - read access to the room
- `room:presence:write` - edit presence (cursor position, avatar, name, etc.)
- `comments:write` - comment on the document

#### Mapping roles to permissions

We will map the roles to the permissions as follows:

| Role        | Permissions                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin`     | `room:write`                                         |
| `commenter` | `room:read`, `room:presence:write`, `comments:write` |
| `viewer`    | `room:read`, `room:presence:write`                   |

### Tenants

Your applications has multiple organizations, each will have its own tenant. For
our example we will have two tenants, each corresponding to an organization.

| Organization Name | Tenant     | Roles                          |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Acme Inc.         | `acme-inc` | `admin`, `commenter`, `viewer` |
| Lumon             | `lumon`    | `admin`, `commenter`, `viewer` |

#### Setting up rooms and tenants

```ts
// example for acme-inc:document:123
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom(
  "acme-inc:document:123", // room id
  {
    defaultAccesses: [], // no public access by default
    tenantId: "acme-inc",
    groupsAccesses: {
      admin: ["room:write"],
      commenter: ["room:read", "room:presence:write", "room:comment:write"],
      viewer: ["room:read", "room:presence:write"],
    },
  }
);

// example for lumon:document:123
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom(
  "lumon:document:123", // room id
  {
    defaultAccesses: [], // no public access by default
    tenantId: "lumon",
    groupsAccesses: {
      admin: ["room:write"],
      commenter: ["room:read", "room:presence:write", "comments:write"],
      viewer: ["room:read", "room:presence:write"],
    },
  }
);
```

<!-- TODO: add visual illustration of rooms and tenants -->

### Users

We will have the following users in our application:

| Name          | User ID                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Mislav Abha   | `mislav.abha@example.com`   |
| Charlie Layne | `charlie.layne@example.com` |

#### Authentication

Now each time a user accesses a tenant, you will identify them and set the
desired role for them.

```ts
// Give Mislav Abha admin access in the Acme Inc. tenant
const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
  userId: "mislav.abha@example.com",
  tenantId: "acme-inc",
  groupIds: ["admin"],
});

// Give Mislav Abha commenter access in the Lumon tenant
const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
  userId: "mislav.abha@example.com",
  tenantId: "lumon",
  groupIds: ["commenter"],
});
```

```ts
// Give Charlie Layne admin access in the Lumon tenant
const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
  userId: "charlie.layne@example.com",
  tenantId: "lumon",
  groupIds: ["admin"],
});

// Give Charlie Layne viewer access in the Acme Inc. tenant
const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
  userId: "charlie.layne@example.com",
  tenantId: "acme-inc",
  groupIds: ["viewer"],
});
```

#### Room specific access

To give enhanced permissions to a user in a room you can set the user's `userId`
as the key and the permissions as the value in the `usersAccesses` property when
creating or updating a room.

```ts
// Mislav Abha is a commenter in the Lumon tenant except for the lumon:document:123 room, where he has admin access.
// We update the room to give Mislav admin access.
const lumonRoom = await liveblocks.updateRoom("lumon:document:123", {
  usersAccesses: {
    "mislav.abha@example.com": ["room:write"], // admin access to the room
  },
});

// Charlie Layne is a commenter in the Acme Inc. tenant except for the acme-inc:document:123 room, where he has admin access.
// We update the room to give Charlie admin access.
const acmeRoom = await liveblocks.updateRoom("acme-inc:document:123", {
  usersAccesses: {
    "charlie.layne@example.com": [
      "room:read",
      "room:presence:write",
      "comments:write",
    ],
  },
});
```
