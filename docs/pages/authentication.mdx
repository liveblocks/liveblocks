Liveblocks provides different methods to authenticate your application using
your public and secret API keys. For any production application, you should use
your secret key to enable [access token](#access-tokens) or
[ID token](#id-tokens) authentication. These methods can be used to control
access to your rooms and data.

We don’t recommend using your public API key in production, as it makes it
possible for end users to access any room’s data. It’s also difficult for us to
accurately measure your monthly collaborating users without any user
information. We recommend using your secret key instead, see below.

## Authentication methods

Secret key authentication in Liveblocks relies on generating
[JSON Web Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) (JWTs), and then
passing these to your client. There are two different types of authentication
tokens you can generate and it’s important to decide on which you need before
setting up your application.

### Access tokens [#access-tokens]

[Access token](/docs/authentication/access-token) authentication allows you to
handle permissions yourself. When a user authenticates, it’s up to you to let
Liveblocks know which rooms they should be allowed inside. This means that you
need to manually keep track of which users should be allowed in which rooms, and
apply these permissions yourself each time a user connects.

</Figure>

In the diagram above, you can see that `olivier@example.com`’s access token is
allowing him into the `Vu78Rt:design:9Hdu73` room. A naming pattern like this is
necessary for your rooms when using access tokens, and it works well for simple
permissions. However, if you need complex permissions, we recommend ID tokens.

### ID tokens [#id-tokens]

[ID token](/docs/authentication/id-token) authentication allows Liveblocks to
handle permissions for you. This means that when you create or modify a room,
you can set a user’s permissions on the room itself, this acting as a source of
truth. Later, when a user tries to enter a room, Liveblocks will automatically
check if the user has permission, and deny them access if the permissions aren’t
set.

  />
</Figure>

In the diagram above, `olivier@example.com`’s ID token verifies his identity,
and when he tries to enter the `a32wQXid4A9` room, his permissions are then
checked on the room itself. ID tokens are best if you need complex permissions
set on different levels (e.g. workspace → team → user).

## Choose a method

- **Access token authentication** is best for prototyping, as it’s easy to set
  up. It’s also ideal if you only need simple permissions, and you’d prefer
  handle these without relying on Liveblocks.
- **ID token authentication** is best if you’d like Liveblocks to automatically
  prevent access to the wrong users. It allows you to set different levels of
  permissions on different users and groups.
