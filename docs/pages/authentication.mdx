Liveblocks provides different methods to authenticate users in your application.
For any production application, we recommend using your secret key to enable
authentication with [ID tokens](#id-tokens).

<Banner title="Public key is only for prototyping and landing pages" type="warning">

We don’t recommend using your public API key in production, as it makes it
possible for end users to access any room’s data. It’s also difficult for us to
accurately measure your monthly collaborating users without any user
information. We recommend using your secret key instead, see below.

ID token authentication allows Liveblocks to handle permissions for you. This
means that when you create or modify a room, you can set a user’s permissions on
the room itself. This means the room acts as a source of truth. Later, when a
user tries to enter a room, Liveblocks will automatically check if the user has
permission, and deny them access if the permissions aren’t set.

Permissions aren’t just for individual users, but can also be set for groups of
users, or for the whole room at once.

<Banner title="You prefer to handle permissions yourself?">

If you don’t need fine-grained permissions, or if you’d prefer storing
individual room permissions in your own system, you can use
[access tokens](/docs/authentication/access-token) instead.

## Authenticating

Authenticating with ID tokens means creating a
[JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) (JWT) that’s used
to verify the identity of the current user when connecting to a Liveblocks room.
This token is created using
[`liveblocks.identifyUser`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#id-tokens).

```ts
const { body, status } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
  userId: "olivier@example.com",
});

// '{ token: "eyJga7..." }'
console.log(body);
```

**Before using ID tokens, it’s recommended to read this entire page**, as it
explains how to set up permissions in your Liveblocks app. However, if you’d
like to quickly set up Liveblocks, you can select your framework and read more
later.

## Permissions [#permissions]

ID token authentication allows you to set different permission types on rooms,
assigned at three different levels: default, groups, and users. The system is
flexible enough to enable you to build a permission system that’s helpful for
building invite dialogs, workspaces, and more.

<Figure>

    src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-share-dialog.png"
    alt="Share dialog illustration"
  />
</Figure>

To set room permissions, you can
[create](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms) or
[update](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId) a room, passing
permission information in the options.

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  // This is a private room
  defaultAccesses: [],

  // But Olivier can enter
  usersAccesses: {
    "olivier@example.com": ["room:read"],
  },
});
```

### Permission types [#permission-types]

There are three permission values that you can set on rooms.

<dl>
  <dt>`["room:write"]`</dt>
  <dd>
    Full access. Enables people to view and edit the room. `isReadOnly` is
    `false`.
  </dd>
  <dt>`["room:read", "room:presence:write"]`</dt>
  <dd>
    Read access with presence. Enables people to edit their presence, but only
    view the room&rsquo;s storage. `isReadOnly` is `true`.
  </dd>
  <dt>`[]`</dt>
  <dd>Private. No one can enter the room.</dd>
</dl>

### Permission levels [#permission-types]

Permission types can be applied at three different levels, enabling complex
entry systems.

<dl>
  <dt>defaultAccesses</dt>
  <dd>The default permission types to apply to the entire room.</dd>
  <dt>groupsAccesses</dt>
  <dd>Permission types to apply to specific groups of users.</dd>
  <dt>usersAccesses</dt>
  <dd>Permission types to apply to specific users.</dd>
</dl>

Each level further down will override access levels defined above, for example a
room with private access will allow a user with `room:write` access to enter.

### Default room permissions

The `defaultAccesses` level is used to set the default permissions of the entire
room.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-access-denied.png"
    alt="Access denied illustration"
    width={820}
    height={412}
  />
</Figure>

When used in our APIs, this property takes an array, with an empty array `[]`
signifying no access. Add permission types to this array to define the default
access level to your room.

```ts
// Private - no one has access by default
"defaultAccesses": []

// Public - everyone can edit and view the room
"defaultAccesses": ["room:write"]

// Read-only - everyone can view the room, but only presence can be edited
"defaultAccesses": ["room:read", "room:presence:write"]
```

#### Setting room access

We can use the
[`liveblocks.createRoom`](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms) to
create a new room with public access levels:

```ts highlight="2"
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  defaultAccesses: ["room:write"],
});
```

The default permission types can later be modified with
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId),
in this example turning the room private:

```ts highlight="2"
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  defaultAccesses: [],
});
```

### Groups permissions

The `groupsAccesses` level is used to set the default permissions of any given
group within room.

<Figure>
  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-groups.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

Groups are represented by a `groupId`—a custom string that represents a
selection of users in your app. Groups can be attached to a user by passing an
array of `groupId` values in `groupIds`, during authentication.

```js highlight="10"
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
    userId: "marie@example.com",
    groupIds: ["engineering"],
  });

  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

In our APIs you can then set group accesses by using the `groupId` as the key,
and an array of permissions as the value.

```ts
// "engineering" group has access to view and edit
"groupsAccesses": {
  "engineering": ["room:write"],
}
```

#### Modifying group access [#permissions-levels-groups-accesses-example]

To allow an “engineering” group access to view a room, and modify their
presence, we can use
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId)
with `engineering` as a `groupId`:

```ts highlight="3"
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  groupsAccesses: {
    engineering: ["room:read", "room:presence:write"],
  },
});
```

After calling this, every user in the “engineering” group will have read-only
access. To remove a group’s permissions, we can use
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId)
again, and set the permission type to `null`:

```ts highlight="7"
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  groupsAccesses: {
    engineering: null,
  },
});
```

### User permissions

The `usersAccesses` level is used to set permissions of any given user within a
room.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-share-dialog.png"
    alt="Share dialog illustration"
    width={820}
    height={412}
  />
</Figure>

To use this, first a user is given a `userId` during authentication.

```js highlight="9"
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
    userId: "ellen@acme.inc",
  });

  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

Then, if you want the user with the `userId` id to make edits, set `userId` to
`["room:write"]` within `usersAccesses` when creating or updating a room.

```ts
// user with userId "ellen@acme.inc" has access to view and edit
"usersAccesses": {
  "ellen@acme.inc": ["room:write"]
}
```

#### Checking user access [#permissions-levels-users-accesses-example]

To give them room permission, we can use
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId),
setting write access on their `userId`:

```ts highlight="3"
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("a32wQXid4A9", {
  usersAccesses: {
    "ellen@acme.inc": ["room:write"],
  },
});
```

To check a user’s assigned permission types for this room, we can then use
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms-roomId)
and check `usersAccesses`:

```ts
const room = await liveblocks.getRoom("a32wQXid4A9");

// { "ellen@acme.inc": ["room:write"] }
console.log(room.data.usersAccesses);
```

## Tenants

You can use [tenants](/docs/authentication/tenants) to compartmentalize your
rooms per customers/organizations that you have.

When using ID tokens, you can set the `tenantId` when using `identifyUser`.

When a token is generated for a specific tenant, it will only give access to
resources inside this tenant, even if the user has access to rooms in other
tenants.

```ts highlight="3"
const { body, status } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
  userId: "olivier@example.com",
  tenantId: "tenant123",
});

// '{ token: "eyJga7..." }'
console.log(body);
```
