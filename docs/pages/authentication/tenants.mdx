Tenants allow you to compartmentalize Liveblocks resources, such as rooms (and
everything associated with a room, including comments and storage), as well as
inbox notifications and AI Copilot Knowledge (soon).

Tenants represent organizations or customers in your system. They are mainly
used for authorization. If you are using tenants, when you generate a client
token, it will only give access to one specified tenant.

Tenants can be used with both [Access Tokens](/docs/authentication/access-token)
and [ID Tokens](/docs/authentication/id-token).

If you don’t set up anything, all resources of a project belong to the same
tenant `default`, and you don’t have to configure anything.

### Setup tenants

To setup tenants, you just need to set a `tenantId` when creating a resource.

For example, to create a room with a specific tenant, you can do:

```ts highlight="2"
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("room1", {
  tenantId: "tenant123",
});
```

When a room, or any other resource is created with a tenant, it's not possible
to change it later. You need to migrate the room into another one in the right
tenant.

You can set the `tenantId` for those resources:

- Rooms (it includes comments and storage)
- Inbox notifications
- Mentions Groups
- AI Copilot Knowledge sources (soon)

### Authentication

Tenants are mainly used for authorization. They have a role to play when you
generate tokens for your users. You can use them with both Access Tokens and ID
Tokens.

#### With Access tokens

When using Access tokens, you can set the tenantId when you prepare a session.
When a token is generated for a specific tenant, it will only give access to
resources inside this tenant, even if the token has permissions to rooms in
other tenants.

```ts highlight="2"
const session = liveblocks.prepareSession("olivier@example.com", {
  tenantId: "tenant123",
});

// Giving full access to one room
session.allow("Vu78Rt:design:9Hdu73", session.FULL_ACCESS);

// Give full access to every room with an ID beginning with "Vu78Rt:product:"
session.allow("Vu78Rt:product:*", session.FULL_ACCESS);

const { body, status } = await session.authorize();
```

You can check more details about
[Access tokens](/docs/authentication/access-token).

#### With ID tokens

When using ID tokens, you can set the `tenantId` when using `identifyUser`.

When a token is generated for a specific tenant, it will only give access to
resources inside this tenant, even if the user has access to rooms in other
tenants.

```ts highlight="3"
const { body, status } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
  userId: "olivier@example.com",
  tenantId: "tenant123",
});

// '{ token: "eyJga7..." }'
console.log(body);
```

You can check more details about [ID tokens](/docs/authentication/id-token).
