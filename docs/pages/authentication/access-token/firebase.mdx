Follow the following steps to start configure your authentication endpoint and
start building your own security logic.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install the `liveblocks/node` package</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      Let’s first install the `@liveblocks/node` package in your
      Firebase functions project.

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/node
      ```

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up authentication endpoint</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Users need permission to interact with rooms, and you can
      permit access by creating a new Firebase [callable function](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable)
      as shown below. In here you can implement your security and define
      the rooms that your user can enter.

      With access tokens, you should always use a [naming pattern](/docs/authentication/access-token#permissions)
      for your room IDs, as this enables you to easily allow
      access to a range of rooms at once. In the code snippet below, we’re using a naming pattern and wildcard `*`
      to give the user access to every room in their organization, and every room in their group.


      ```js
      const functions = require("firebase-functions");
      const { Liveblocks } = require("@liveblocks/node");

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
      });

      exports.auth = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
        // Get the current user from your database
        const user = __getUserFromDB__(data);

        // Start an auth session inside your endpoint
        const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
          user.id,
          { userInfo: user.metadata },  // Optional
        );

        // Use a naming pattern to allow access to rooms with wildcards
        // Giving the user read access on their org, and write access on their group
        session.allow(`${user.organization}:*`, session.READ_ACCESS);
        session.allow(`${user.organization}:${user.group}:*`, session.FULL_ACCESS);

        // Authorize the user and return the result
        const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
        return JSON.parse(body);
      });
      ```

      Read
      [access token permission](/docs/authentication/access-token#permissions)
      to learn more about naming rooms and granting permissions with wildcards.
      Note that if a naming pattern doesn’t work for every room in your application, you can
      [grant access to individual rooms too](/docs/guides/how-to-grant-access-to-individual-rooms-with-access-tokens).

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Set up the client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      On the front end, you can now replace the `publicApiKey`
      option with `authEndpoint` pointing to the endpoint you
      just created.

      ```js
      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
      import firebase from "firebase";
      import "firebase/functions";

      firebase.initializeApp({
        /* Firebase config */
      });

      const auth = firebase.functions().httpsCallable("liveblocks-auth");

      // Create a Liveblocks client
      const client = createClient({
        authEndpoint: async (room) => (await auth({ room })).data,
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## More information

Both `userId` and `userInfo` can then be used in your JavaScript application as
such:

```ts
const self = room.getSelf(); // or useSelf() in React
console.log(self.id);
console.log(self.info);
```
