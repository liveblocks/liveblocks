Follow the following steps to start configure your authentication endpoint and
start building your own security logic.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install the `liveblocks/node` package</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/node
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up authentication endpoint</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      Users need permission to interact with rooms, and you can
      permit access in an `api/liveblocks-auth` endpoint by
      creating the `src/routes/api/liveblocks-auth/+server.ts` file with the
      following code. In here you can implement your security and define
      the rooms that your user can enter.

      With access tokens, you should always use a [naming pattern](/docs/authentication/access-token#permissions)
      for your room IDs, as this enables you to easily allow
      access to a range of rooms at once. In the code snippet below, we’re using a naming pattern and wildcard `*`
      to give the user access to every room in their organization, and every room in their group.


      ```ts file="src/routes/api/liveblocks-auth/+server.ts"
      import { type RequestEvent } from "@sveltejs/kit";
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
      });

      export async function POST({ request }: RequestEvent) {
        // Get the current user from your database
        const user = __getUserFromDB__(request);

        // Start an auth session inside your endpoint
        const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
          user.id,
          { userInfo: user.metadata },  // Optional
        );

        // Use a naming pattern to allow access to rooms with wildcards
        // Giving the user read access on their org, and write access on their group
        session.allow(`${user.organization}:*`, session.READ_ACCESS);
        session.allow(`${user.organization}:${user.group}:*`, session.FULL_ACCESS);

        // Authorize the user and return the result
        const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
        return new Response(body, { status });
      }
      ```

      Read
      [access token permission](/docs/authentication/access-token#permissions)
      to learn more about naming rooms and granting permissions with wildcards.
      Note that if a naming pattern doesn’t work for every room in your application, you can
      [grant access to individual rooms too](/docs/guides/how-to-grant-access-to-individual-rooms-with-access-tokens).

  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Set up the client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      On the front end, you can now replace the `publicApiKey`
      option with `authEndpoint` pointing to the endpoint you
      just created.

      ```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

      const client = createClient({
        authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
      });
      ```

      If you need to pass custom headers or data to your endpoint, you can
      use
      [authEndpoint as a callback](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientCallback)
      instead.

      ```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts" isCollapsed isCollapsable
      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

      // Passing custom headers and body to your endpoint
      const client = createClient({
        authEndpoint: async (room) => {
          const headers = {
            // Custom headers
            // ...

            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          };

          const body = JSON.stringify({
            // Custom body
            // ...

            room,
          });

          const response = await fetch("/api/liveblocks-auth", {
            method: "POST",
            headers,
            body,
          });

          return await response.json();
        },
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## More information

Both `userId` and `userInfo` can then be used in your Svelte application as
such:

```ts
const self = room.getSelf();
console.log(self.id);
console.log(self.info.color);
```
