Access token authentication allows you to handle permissions yourself. When a
user authenticates, it’s up to you to let Liveblocks know which rooms they
should be allowed inside. This means that you need to manually keep track of
which users should be allowed in which rooms, and apply these permissions
yourself each time a user connects.

In the diagram above, you can see that `olivier@example.com`’s access token is
allowing him into the `Vu78Rt::design/9Hdu73` room.
