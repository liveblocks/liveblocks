Access token authentication allows you to handle permissions yourself. When a
user authenticates, it’s up to you to let Liveblocks know which rooms they
should be allowed inside. This means that you need to manually keep track of
which users should be allowed in which rooms, and apply these permissions
yourself each time a user connects.

If you’re looking to build an application with permissions at organization,
group, and user levels, we recommend using
[ID tokens](/docs/authentication/id-token) instead. Access tokens have
[limitations when granting nested permissions](#limitations).

## Authenticating

Authenticating with access tokens means creating a
[JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) (JWT) that grants
the current user permission to enter certain rooms when connecting to
Liveblocks. An access token is created by calling
[`liveblocks.prepareSession`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#access-tokens)
then by allowing access to certain rooms.

```ts
const session = liveblocks.prepareSession("olivier@example.com");

// Giving write access to one room, then read access to multiple rooms with a wildcard
session.allow("Vu78Rt:design:9Hdu73", session.FULL_ACCESS);
session.allow("Vu78Rt:product:*", session.READ_ACCESS);

const { body, status } = await session.authorize();

// '{ token: "j6Fga7..." }'
console.log(body);
```

**Before using access tokens, it’s recommended to read through this entire
page**, as it explains helpful practices for granting access to rooms. However,
if you’d like to get set up now, you can select your framework and read more
later.

## Permissions [#permissions]

### Default permissions

When creating rooms automatically with
[`RoomProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RoomProvider) **every room
is publicly available**. If you’d like to prevent unauthenticated access to your
room data, you must instead set permissions on your back end using the
[Liveblocks Node.js package](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints), or the
[REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints).

#### Permission types [#permission-types]

There are three permission values that you can set as default on rooms.

<dl>
  <dt>`["room:write"]`</dt>
  <dd>
    Full access. Enables people to view and edit the room. `isReadOnly` is
    `false`. Also known as `session.FULL_ACCESS`.
  </dd>
  <dt>`["room:read", "room:presence:write"]`</dt>
  <dd>
    Read access with presence. Enables people to edit their presence, but only
    view the room&rsquo;s storage. `isReadOnly` is `true`. Also known as
    `session.READ_ACCESS`.
  </dd>
  <dt>`[]`</dt>
  <dd>
    Private. Only users that have been given explicit access can enter the room.
  </dd>
</dl>

#### Setting default permissions

The `defaultAccesses` level is used to set the default permissions of the entire
room.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/managing-rooms/rooms-access-denied.png"
    alt="Access denied illustration"
    width={820}
    height={412}
  />
</Figure>

We can use the
[`liveblocks.createRoom`](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms) to
create a new room with private access by default:

```ts highlight="2"
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom("Vu78Rt:design:9Hdu73", {
  defaultAccesses: [],
});
```

We could also later modify the value with
[`liveblocks.updateRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId),
in this example turning the room read-only:

```ts highlight="2"
const room = await liveblocks.updateRoom("Vu78Rt:design:9Hdu73", {
  defaultAccesses: ["room:read", "room:presence:write"],
});
```

### Advanced permissions

Along with default permissions, you can assign advanced permissions to
individual users. These permissions will override any default permissions.

When granting advanced permissions using access tokens, it’s recommended to use
a naming pattern for your room IDs. This makes it easy to use wildcard
permissions, allowing you to authenticate access to multiple rooms at once. One
scenario where this is helpful, is when rooms and users in your app are part of
an organization (or workspace), and you need to permit users entry to each room
that’s part of this.

#### Organization hierarchy

Let’s picture an organization, a customer in your product. This organization has
a number of groups (or teams), and each group can create documents that other
members of the group can view.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/authentication/room-organizations.png"
    srcDark="/assets/authentication/room-organizations-dark.png"
    alt="An organization with documents in different teams"
    width={1536}
    height={864}
    quality={100}
  />
</Figure>

In your application, each organization, group, and document has a unique ID, and
we can use these to create a naming pattern for your rooms. For example, in the
diagram above, the Acme organization (`Vu78Rt`) has a Product group (`product`)
with two documents inside (`6Dsw12`, `L2hr8p`).

#### Naming pattern

An example of a naming pattern would be to combine the three IDs into a unique
room ID separating them with symbols, such as
`<organization_id>:<group_id>:<document_id>`. A room ID following this pattern
may look like `Vu78Rt:product:6Dsw1z`.

<Figure>

    src="/assets/authentication/room-name-pattern.png"
    srcDark="/assets/authentication/room-name-pattern-dark.png"
    alt="Splitting a room ID into the pattern detailed above"
    width={1536}
    height={864}
    quality={100}
  />
</Figure>

<Banner title="Example pattern">

This example is not a strict naming pattern you must follow, and you can use any
pattern you like. Take care to avoid using your separator character in any other
part of the room ID.

</Banner>

#### Wildcard permissions

Assuming you’re using the naming pattern displayed above, you can then grant
access to multiple rooms at once using wildcards.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/authentication/access-token-room-naming.png"
    alt="An access token using a wildcard to access multiple rooms"
    width={1494}
    height={840}
    quality={100}
  />
</Figure>

In the image above, you can see that _Olivier_ has access to multiple _product_
rooms, thanks to the `Vu78Rt:product:*` wildcard rule. This is how he was
authorized:

```ts
const session = liveblocks.prepareSession("olivier@example.com");

// Giving full access to one room
session.allow("Vu78Rt:design:9Hdu73", session.FULL_ACCESS);

// Give full access to every room with an ID beginning with "Vu78Rt:product:"
session.allow("Vu78Rt:product:*", session.FULL_ACCESS);

const { body, status } = await session.authorize();
```

Note that you can only use a wildcard at the end of a room ID.

```jsx
// ❌ Wildcard must be at the end of the room ID
session.allow("Vu78Rt:*:product", session.FULL_ACCESS);

// ✅ Valid wildcard
session.allow("Vu78Rt:product:*", session.FULL_ACCESS);
```

#### Read-only access

Should we wish to grant read-only access to each room in the organization, we
then add another line to enable this.

```ts highlight="9-10"
const session = liveblocks.prepareSession("olivier@example.com");

// Giving full access to one room
session.allow("Vu78Rt:design:9Hdu73", session.FULL_ACCESS);

// Give full access to every room with an ID beginning with "Vu78Rt:product:"
session.allow("Vu78Rt:product:*", session.FULL_ACCESS);

// Give read-only access to every room in the `Vu78Rt` organization
session.allow("Vu78Rt:*", session.READ_ACCESS);

const { body, status } = await session.authorize();
```

#### Limitations [#limitations]

There’s a limitation with access tokens related to granting access to individual
rooms that are part of groups. Let’s say a user has been given access to every
`product` room in their organization.

```tsx
// Access to every `product` room
session.allow("Vu78Rt:product:*", session.FULL_ACCESS);
```

This user is able to enter `product` rooms, but has no access to any `design`
rooms.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/authentication/access-token-product-access.png"
    alt="An access token using a wildcard to access product rooms"
    width={1494}
    height={840}
    quality={100}
  />
</Figure>

Let’s say the user is invited to a `design` room via share menu—how would we
grant them access?

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/authentication/access-token-room-invite.png"
    alt="Inviting Olivier to the `Vu78Rt:design:9Hdu73` room"
    width={1494}
    height={840}
    quality={100}
  />
</Figure>

We can’t give them access to _every_ `design` room with a wildcard, as they
should only have permission for _one_.

```tsx
// ❌ Access to every `design` room
session.allow("Vu78Rt:design:*", session.FULL_ACCESS);
```

Instead, we would have to manually find the exact room ID without a wildcard,
and apply it ourselves—the naming pattern doesn’t work for this room.

```tsx
// Access to just this `design` room, but not scalable
session.allow("Vu78Rt:design:9Hdu73", session.FULL_ACCESS);
```

To use access tokens you’d have to manually keep track of every room ID where
the naming pattern doesn’t apply. This isn’t ideal, and it also doesn’t scale,
as the token will need to be refreshed whenever access is granted to new rooms
for this to work correctly.

##### Building more complex permissions

For this reason,
**[we recommend using ID tokens for complex permissions](/docs/authentication/id-token)**.
ID token authentication allows you to attach permissions to each room when it’s
created or modified, which means you don’t need to check permissions yourself,
and no naming pattern is required.

#### Migrating your current rooms IDs

If your application already has rooms, it’s possible to rename their IDs to be
compatible with a naming pattern. Learn more in our
[room ID migration guide](/docs/guides/how-to-rename-room-ids-and-successfully-migrate-users).
