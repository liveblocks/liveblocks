ID token authentication allows Liveblocks to handle permissions for you. This
means that when you create or modify a room, you can set a user’s permissions on
the room itself, this acting as a source of truth. Later, when a user tries to
enter a room, Liveblocks will automatically check if the user has permission,
and deny them access if the permissions aren’t set.

In the diagram above, `olivier@example.com`’s ID token verifies his identity,
and when he tries to enter the `Vu78Rt::design/9Hdu73` room, his permissions are
then checked on the room itself.
