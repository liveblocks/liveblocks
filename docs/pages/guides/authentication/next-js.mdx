    "Learn how to setup a Liveblocks authentication endpoint with Next.js"
---

This guide assumes that you already have
[installed Liveblocks into your project](/docs/get-started/react) and that
you’re already familiar with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

Alternatively, you can copy this example and follow the instructions in the
README:

- [Live Avatar Stack](/examples/live-avatar-stack/nextjs)

## Install the Liveblocks package [#setup]

Run the following command to install Liveblocks package:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/node
```

[`@liveblocks/node`][] is used from the backend to setup the authentication
endpoint.

## Setup authentication endpoint [#authentication]

Users can only interact with rooms they have access to. You can configure
permission access in an `api/auth` endpoint by creating the `pages/api/auth.js`
file with the following code. This is where you will implement your security and
define if the current user has access to a specific room.

```js
import { authorize } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Replace this key with your secret key provided at
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
const secret = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";

export default async function auth(req, res) {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  const room = req.body.room;
  const result = await authorize({
    room,
    secret,
    userId: "123", // Optional
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional, corresponds to the UserMeta[info] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
      color: "red"
    },
  });
  return res.status(result.status).end(result.body);
}
```
The `userId` used in the `authorize` function corresponds to userId used in our APIs when setting permissions (e.g. in create room).
You can use the following example to use data from `userId` and `userInfo` on the front end.
```ts
  const self = useSelf();

  // "123"
  console.log(self.id);

  // "red"
  console.log(self.info.color);

  // ...
}
```

Here is a diagram that shows how things work behind the scenes:

## Connect to Liveblocks

To connect to Liveblocks, you need to create a Liveblocks client with
[`createClient`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClient) from the front-end and set the `authEndpoint` option based on
the path of the endpoint created earlier.

```js
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

// Create a Liveblocks client
const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/auth",
});
```

Liveblocks should now be integrated with your product!
