    "Learn how to setup a Liveblocks authentication endpoint with Firebase"

This guide assumes that you already have
[installed Liveblocks into your project](/docs/get-started/javascript) and that
you’re already familiar with
[Firebase functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started).

## Install the Liveblocks package [#setup]

To do that, let’s first install [`@liveblocks/node`][] package in your Firebase
functions project.

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/node
```

## Setup authentication endpoint [#authentication]

Next, create a new Firebase
[callable function](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable) as
shown below. This is where you will implement your security and define if the
current user has access to a specific room.

```js
const functions = require("firebase-functions");
const { authorize } = require("@liveblocks/node");

exports.auth = functions.https.onCall((data, context) => {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  return authorize({
    room: data.room,
    secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    userId: "123", // Optional
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional, corresponds to the UserMeta[info] info defined in liveblocks.config.ts
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
      color: "red"
    },
  }).then((authResult) => {
    if (authResult.status !== 200) {
      throw new functions.https.HttpsError(authResult.status, authResult.body);
    }
    return JSON.parse(authResult.body);
  });
});
```

The `userId` used in the `authorize` function corresponds to userId used in our APIs when setting permissions (e.g. in create room).
You can use the following example to use data from `userId` and `userInfo`on the front end.
```ts
  const self = useSelf();

  // "123"
  console.log(self.id);

  // "red"
  console.log(self.info.color);

  // ...
}
```

Then, deploy your function with `firebase deploy --only functions:auth`.

Here is a diagram that shows how things work behind the scenes:

## Connect to Liveblocks

To connect to Liveblocks, you need to create a Liveblocks client with
[`createClient`][] from the front-end and set the `authEndpoint` option based on
the previously created “callable function”:

```js
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import firebase from "firebase";
import "firebase/functions";

firebase.initializeApp({
  /* Firebase config */
});

const auth = firebase.functions().httpsCallable("auth");

// Create a Liveblocks client
const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: async (room) => (await auth({ room })).data,
});
```

Liveblocks should now be integrated with your product!
