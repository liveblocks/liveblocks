    "Learn how to setup a Liveblocks authentication endpoint with Express"
---

This guide assumes that you already have
[installed Liveblocks into your project](/docs/get-started/javascript) and that
youâ€™re already familiar with [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

## Install the Liveblocks package [#setup]

Run the following command to install Liveblocks package:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/node
```

[`@liveblocks/node`][] is used from the backend to setup the authentication
endpoint.

## Setup authentication endpoint [#authentication]

Users can only interact with rooms they have access to. You can configure
permission access by creating a REST endpoint on your express server. You will
implement your own security and define if the current user has access to a
specific room.

Create a POST endpoint that will read the room from the JSON body. Ensure that
the caller of this endpoint is a valid user by validating the cookies or
authentication headers and that it has access to the requested room. Then use
[`authorize`][] to generate a token and return the body as a response.

```js
const express = require("express");
const { authorize } = require("@liveblocks/node");

// Replace this key with your secret key provided at
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
const secret = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/api/auth", (req, res) => {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  authorize({
    room: req.body.room,
    secret,
    userId: "123", // Optional
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
    },
  })
    .then((authResponse) => {
      res.send(authResponse.body);
    })
    .catch((er) => {
      res.status(403).end();
    });
});
```

Here is a diagram that shows how things work behind the scenes.

## Connect to Liveblocks

To connect to Liveblocks, you need to create a Liveblocks client with
[`createClient`][] from the front-end and set the `authEndpoint` option based on
the path of the endpoint created earlier.

```js
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

// Create a Liveblocks client
const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/auth",
});
```

Liveblocks should now be integrated with your product!
