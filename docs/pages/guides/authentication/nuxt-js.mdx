    "Learn how to setup a Liveblocks authentication endpoint with Nuxt.js"
---

This guide assumes that you already have
[installed Liveblocks into your project](/docs/get-started/vue) and that you’re
already familiar with
[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation).

Alternatively, you can copy this example and follow the instructions in the
README:

- [Live Avatar Stack](/examples/live-avatar-stack/nuxtjs)

## Install the Liveblocks package [#setup]

Run the following command to install Liveblocks package:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/node typescript --save-dev
```

[`@liveblocks/node`][] is used from the backend to setup the authentication
endpoint.

## Setup authentication endpoint [#authentication]

Users can only interact with rooms they have access to. You can configure
permission access by creating a REST endpoint in your Nuxt app. You will
implement your own security and define if the current user has access to a
specific room.

One way to create an API endpoint in your Nuxt app is to create a
[server middleware to extend Express](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/configuration-glossary/configuration-servermiddleware#custom-api-endpoint).
Modify your `nuxt.config.js` with the following config.

```ts file="nuxt.config.ts"
serverMiddleware: [{ path: "/api", handler: "~/api" }];
```

Then create a file called `api.ts` at the root of your project and add an
Express endpoint like below.

```ts file="api.ts"
import { authorize } from "@liveblocks/node";
import express from "express";

// Replace this key with your secret key provided at
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
const secret = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/auth", (req, res) => {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It's your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  authorize({
    room: req.body.room,
    secret: secret,
    userId: "123", // Optional
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
    },
  })
    .then((authResponse) => {
      res.send(authResponse.body);
    })
    .catch((er) => {
      res.status(403).end();
    });
});
```

Here is a diagram that shows how things work behind the scenes:

## Connect to Liveblocks

To connect to Liveblocks, you need to create a Liveblocks client with
[`createClient`][] from the front-end and set the `authEndpoint` option based on
the path of the endpoint created earlier.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

// Create a Liveblocks client
const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/auth",
});
```

Liveblocks should now be integrated with your product!
