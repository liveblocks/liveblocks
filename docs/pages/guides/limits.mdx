## Connections

A connection is when a user initially connects to a Liveblocks room. If a user
connects to your product on two different browsers and their phone, that would
be three connections.

### Connections per month

This limit can be hit when too many connections are established during the
monthly billing period:

- Starter plan: <Limits.FreeMonthlyConnections /> connections per month.
- Pro plan: <Limits.ProMonthlyConnections /> connections per month included +
  $<Limits.ProExtraConnectionsPrice /> per extra connection
- Organization plan: custom connections per month

When this limit is reached, your account will still work and you won’t be
charged on an occasional traffic spike. We’ll email you to kindly ask you
upgrade your plan if you keep hitting that limit. You will never be charged
extra for an occasional traffic spike. We will never stop counting your stats
because of an occasional traffic spike. There are no surprise fees and your card
will never be charged unexpectedly.

### Simultaneous connections per room

This limit can be hit when too many simultaneous connections are established on
a single room:

- Starter plan: <Limits.FreeMaxConnectionsPerRoom /> simultaneous connections
  per room
- Pro plan: <Limits.ProMaxConnectionsPerRoom /> simultaneous connections per
  room
- Organization plan: custom simultaneous connections per room

When this limit is reached, the server declines the connection and the
Liveblocks client raises the error with the code “4005”.

## Other limits

### Room `id`

A room `id` cannot exceed 128 characters.

### User `id`

A user `id` cannot exceed 128 characters.

### User information

User information sent from the authentication endpoint cannot exceed 1024
characters once serialized to JSON.

### Storage

The value of a `LiveObject`, `LiveList`, and `LiveMap` storage item cannot
exceed 128 kB. This limit can be increased on the Organization plan.
