All Liveblocks subscription plans are subject to this Fair Use Policy.

## Usage guidelines

We have established guidelines for our communityâ€™s usage of our plans. Most
users should fall within the specified ranges, however, if usage is excessive,
we will notify you and work to address the issue. Our aim is to be accommodating
while maintaining the stability of our infrastructure.
