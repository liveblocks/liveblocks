## What are Liveblocks DevTools?

Our [DevTools](/devtools) are a browser-based extension that integrates with
Liveblocks and your local development environment. This allows you to easily
inspect, visualize, and troubleshoot your collaborative online experiences.

[live demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Jxejp0iuw) on YouTube.

## How DevTools work

Our DevTools communicate with Liveblocks servers in development mode and
retrieve the current state of storage and presence (and history is coming
soon!). The DevTools support one-way data syncs from the Liveblocks client and
are compiled away in production, similar to other DevTools like React and Redux.

<Banner title="Devtools Compatibility with legacy packages">

Our DevTools are currently only available if you are on Liveblocks 0.19 or
later. To view step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade your project to
Liveblocks 0.19, check out our [upgrade guides](/guides/upgrading/).

## How to use DevTools

### Install the browser extension

Our DevTools extension is available for all major web browsers:

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/liveblocks-devtools/iiagocfmmhknpdalddkbiejnfmbmlffk)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/liveblocks-devtools/)
- [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/liveblocks-devtools/hfecmmnilleegmjaegkjjklnjbgadikg)

### Features and tips

- You can quickly expand and collapse nested objects within storage by holding
  the `‚å•` key (option on Mac) and clicking on the object.
- You can expand and collapse objects with one level of depth by using the arrow
  keys or spacebar.
- When a value in storage changes, the DevTools will highlight the value to
  indicate that it has changed.
- Storage values are searchable by key.
- Hovering over a value in storage makes a tooltip appear. If clicked, it
  displays the value of that key.

### If DevTools shows an empty page

If you open Devtools after a Liveblocks client has already been initialized, you
may see an empty page. This is because the DevTools are only able to retrieve
the current state of storage and presence. To fix this, you can refresh the page
or open DevTools before initializing the Liveblocks client.

## Using DevTools with the Liveblocks starter kit

The Next.js starter kit is a great way to get started with Liveblocks and learn
how to use DevTools.

    />
  </video>

To use the starter kit with DevTools, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --next
```

You can then follow the guided prompts in the terminal to create your project.
For additional information on how to use the starter kit, see the
[starter kit guide](docs/guides/nextjs-starter-kit).

Once you have completed the starter kit prompts and installed the extension,
open Chrome (or your preferred browser) and the DevTools panel. You should see
the Liveblocks DevTools extension in the list of extensions. Click on the
extension to open it up.

Now you can run the starter kit by running `npm run dev` and navigating to
`localhost:3000`. You should see the values from the starter kit populating.

## Trying DevTools with a Liveblocks example

All of our examples hosted on Liveblocks.io are available for you to run locally
from the [examples directory](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/examples) in
the Liveblocks repo. For testing and reviewing how to use DevTools, we will
use the
[Advanced Collaborative Spreadsheet](https://liveblocks.io/examples/collaborative-spreadsheet-advanced/nextjs).

To clone the Git repository and run the example, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks.git
cd examples/nextjs-spreadsheet-advanced/
```

```bash
npm install
```

Then, create the `.env.local` file with your `LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY`. Obtain your secret key from [here](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/apikeys).

```bash file=".env.local"
LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY="sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Open Chrome or your preferred browser and open up the DevTools panel. You should
see the Liveblocks DevTools extension in the list of extensions. Click on the
extension to open it up. Now you can run our example by running npm run dev and
navigating to http://localhost:3000, and you should see the values from the
spreadsheet examples populating storage.
