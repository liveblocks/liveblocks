    collaborative application."

Our [DevTools](/devtools) is a browser-based extension that integrates with
Liveblocks and your local development environment. This allows you to easily
inspect, visualize, and troubleshoot your collaborative online experiences.

DevTools is currently only available if you are on Liveblocks 1.0 or later. To
view step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade your project to Liveblocks 1.0,
check out our [upgrade guides](/guides/upgrading/).

## Install the browser extension

Our DevTools extension is available for all major web browsers:

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/liveblocks-devtools/iiagocfmmhknpdalddkbiejnfmbmlffk)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/liveblocks-devtools/)
- [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/liveblocks-devtools/hfecmmnilleegmjaegkjjklnjbgadikg)

Within the “Liveblocks” panel, you will see two panes: storage and presence. The
storage pane represents each object that you have defined in storage as a tree,
likewise, the presence pane represents each user that is connected to your
Liveblocks project.

## Trying DevTools

### With our Starter Kit

The [Liveblocks Starter Kit](/starter-kit) is a great way to get started with
Liveblocks and learn how to use DevTools.

      src="/images/docs/devtools/liveblocks-devtools-starter-kit.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>
To use the Starter Kit with DevTools, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --next
```

You can then follow the guided prompts in the terminal to create your project.
For additional information on how to use the Starter Kit, see the
[Starter Kit guide](docs/guides/nextjs-starter-kit).

Once you have completed the Starter Kit prompts and installed the extension, run
the Starter Kit with `npm run dev` and open your browser and to
`localhost:3000`. You should authenticate, and then create a new draft document.
Once you have created a new document, open up the developer tools window. Find
the newly available “Liveblocks” panel there.

### With an example from our gallery

All of our examples hosted on Liveblocks.io are available for you to run locally
from the
[examples directory](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/examples)
in the Liveblocks repo. For testing and reviewing how to use DevTools, we will
use the
[Advanced Collaborative Spreadsheet](https://liveblocks.io/examples/collaborative-spreadsheet-advanced/nextjs).

To clone the Git repository and run the example, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks.git
```

```bash
cd liveblocks/examples/nextjs-collaborative-spreadsheet-advanced
```

```bash
npm install
```

Then, create the `.env.local` file with your `LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY`. Obtain
your secret key from [here](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/apikeys).

```bash file=".env.local"
LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY="sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Open your browser and open up the developer tools window. Find the newly
available “Liveblocks” panel there.

    quality={90}
  />
</Figure>

Now you can run our example by running `npm run dev` and navigating to
`http://localhost:3000`, and you should see the values from the spreadsheet
examples populating storage.

## Features and tips

### Highlighting

When a value in storage changes, the DevTools will highlight the value to
indicate that it has changed.

### Search

Storage values are searchable by key and regex.

### Hover

Hovering over a value in storage or presence makes an eye icon appear. If
clicked, it displays the value of that key.

### Expand and collapse

- You can expand and collapse objects with one level of depth by using the arrow
  keys or spacebar.
- You can quickly expand and collapse nested objects within storage by holding
  the `⌥` key (option on Mac) and clicking on the object.

<Banner title="Initialization">

If you open DevTools after a Liveblocks client has already been initialized, you
may see an empty page. This is because DevTools is only able to retrieve the
current state of storage and presence. To fix this, you can refresh the page or
open DevTools before initializing the Liveblocks client.
