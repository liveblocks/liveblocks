With the release of Liveblocks 1.0, we included new pricing plans that are based
on Monthly Active Users (MAU). This guide will help you understand how to use
the new pricing plans by providing guidance on the migration to Liveblocks 1.0
and how to include a `userId` when generating a token with the secret API key.

## What is a Monthly Active User (MAU)? [#what-is-mau]

In versions before 1.0 we used the number of connections to determine pricing
segments. We counted each time a user connected to a Liveblocks room from a
physical device as a connection. We introduced pricing based on Monthly Active
Users (MAU) to reflect the value that Liveblocks offers to our customers. MAU
makes pricing more predictable for our users by associating connections to
users.

A monthly active user can be defined as:

- A `userId` that connects to a Liveblocks room at least once a month (if using
  authorization with a secret API key)
- An anonymous user who connects to a Liveblocks room, at least once a month who
  can be identified by a cookie (if using authorization with the public API key)

## How does authorization work with MAU? [#authorization]

### When using @liveblocks/node’s authorize function [#node]

In `@liveblocks/node`, we made the field `userId` in the `authorize` option
mandatory. This `userId` is used to track MAU associated with a Liveblocks
account. Each `userId` will count as one MAU. To make sure you begin to track MAU
as intended, first update `@liveblocks/node`.

```bash
npm update @liveblocks/node@1.0
```

Then, update the `authorize` function to include the `userId` field.

```ts highlight="16,20"
import { authorize } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Replace this key with your secret key provided at
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
const secret = "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

export default async function auth(req, res) {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It’s your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  const room = req.body.room;
  const response = await authorize({
    room,
    secret,
    // Corresponds to the UserMeta[id] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
    userId: "123",
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional, corresponds to the UserMeta[info] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
      color: "red",
    },
  });
  return res.status(response.status).end(response.body);
}
```

<Banner title="Using a secret key with authorization">
  To use the `authorize` method, you need to have your own back-end endpoint
  which handles authentication. Your Liveblocks dashboard contains the secret
  key required to use the `authorize` option.
</Banner>

### When calling the authorize API endpoint [#authorize-endpoint]

When calling the `authorize` endpoint directly with a secret key, the `userId`
is not required. However, should still include the `userId` in the request body
to take advantage of MAU pricing logic. Set the `Authorization: Bearer` header
to your secret key, then POST to the following endpoint:

```ts
POST https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/{roomId}/authorize
```

Set the following request body:

```ts highlight="2"
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "groupIds": [
    "g1",
    "g2"
  ],
  "userInfo": {
    "name": "bob",
    "colors": [
      "blue",
      "red"
    ]
  }
}
```

To learn more about authorization and authentication in your Liveblocks
application, check out our [Authentication guide](/docs/guides/authentication).

## How is MAU calculated when using a public key? [#public-key]

To take advantage of Liveblocks 1.0 pricing without authorization, you must
update your Liveblocks packages to 1.0. We will count each connection as one MAU
if you do not update your packages to 1.0. Once the packages are updated, a
cookie will be set on the client to track when a new user connects to a room.
This cookie will track MAU associated with a Liveblocks account and expire after
30 days.

Inside the `createClient` function, you will use your public key instead of a
private key.

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="4"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "pk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});
```

To illustrate how counting MAU works without a `userId`, consider the following:

If you have one user who connects to a Liveblocks room that does not enforce
authorization, you will be billed for one MAU. That same person can reaccess a
room the next day, and MAU would not increase. The cookie will expire at the end
of the 30-day billing cycle, and the user will be counted as a new MAU.
Liveblocks will count that anonymous user as two MAU if packages are not updated.

## Development use [#development-use]

While working in development mode, you will not be billed for MAU. However, you
will still need to include a `userId` in the `authorize` option if you use it.
We are currently working on updating our dashboard to reflect the number of MAU
for development use.

If you call Liveblocks API during any automated testing, you may want
to provide a static `userId` to avoid hitting rate limits. You can do this by
setting an environment variable and checking the process when you call
`authorize` from `@liveblocks/node`.

```dotenv file=".env.test"
 TEST_USERID="machine"
```

```ts highlight="20,21"
import { authorize } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Replace this key with your secret key provided at
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
const secret = "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

export default async function auth(req, res) {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It’s your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  const room = req.body.room;
  const response = await authorize({
    room,
    secret,
    // Corresponds to the UserMeta[id] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
    userId:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === "test" ? process.env.TEST_USERID : "user123",
    // Check whether you are in the testing environment when passing the userId
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional, corresponds to the UserMeta[info] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
      color: "red",
    },
  });
  return res.status(response.status).end(response.body);
}
```

## How to migrate to Liveblocks 1.0 [#migration]

To update to Liveblocks 1.0, you will need to update your Liveblocks packages:

```bash
npm update @liveblocks/node @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react
```

You will then pick one of the two methods outlined above for tracking MAU:
[authorization](#authorization) or [public key](#public-key). After completing
these steps to take advantage of the new pricing model, you should review the
[Liveblocks 1.0 upgrade guide](/docs/guides/upgrading/1.0) for additional
details on migrating Liveblocks 1.0.
