In this guide, we will explain how to use webhooks within your product so that
you can react to Liveblocks events as they happen. Now that our platform is
observable, you can use webhooks to reduce development time and the need for
polling.

## What is a webhook?

Webhooks make a platform observable. They let users subscribe to events on the
platform for them to react to. In this sense, webhooks streamline the collection
of data between two connected services.

Like an API, webhooks are a mechanism for a client to receive data. The main
difference between webhooks and APIs is that a webhook functions as an inverted
API. A traditional API receives requests and sends responses, whereas a webhook
is an endpoint that you provide where we send events.

The lifecycle of a webhook:

1. You create and provide a client endpoint, which listens to event messages
2. The Liveblocks server broadcasts a message (event) to the client endpoint
   when an event occurs
3. You verify the message request sent to the endpoint and send a 200 response
   once the request has been verified
4. You use the message payload to trigger a task

Steps 2-4 will be repeated as long as you are subscribed to Liveblocks events.

In this way, webhooks provide a real-time connection between two services. While
APIs are useful for obtaining data on a scheduled basis, they are not efficient
for observing changes on a platform that has a high volume of activity.

## Concepts

### Messages

A message is generated for each event that happens within Liveblocks, as defined
in the Event Catalog. Messages contain a `type` along with data attached to it.
The message request contains headers used for security purposes.

### Events

An event occurs when a change is made to Liveblocks data. Updates to storage and
rooms are common events that will trigger a message. Each endpoint you provide
in the webhooks dashboard listens to all events by default but can be easily
configured to only listen to a subset by updating the Message Filtering section.
As a new user, you may opt to listen to all events or subscribe to only the ones
that are relevant to your use case.

Alternatively, you can use the Event Catalog provided as a way to determine
which events make the most sense. The Event Catalog provides a list of events
available for subscription, along with their schema.

Events available for use include:

- UserEntered/UserLeft
- StorageUpdated

More events will come later such as:

- RoomCreated/RoomDeleted
- MaxConnectionsReached

#### UserEnteredEvent

A user enters a room when they connect to a room, which is when this event is
triggered. The `numActiveUsers` field represents the number of users in the room
after the user has entered. This event is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type UserEnteredEvent = {
  type: "userEntered";
  data: {
    appId: string;
    roomId: string;
    connectionId: number;
    userId: string | null;
    userInfo: Record<string, any> | null;
    enteredAt: string;
    numActiveUsers: number;
  };
};

// Example
const userEnteredEvent = {
  type: "userEntered",
  data: {
    appId: "my-app-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    connectionId: 4,
    userId: "a-user-id",
    userInfo: null,
    enteredAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    numActiveUsers: 8,
  },
};
```

#### UserLeftEvent

A user leaves a room when they disconnect from a room, which is when this event
is triggered. The `numActiveUsers` field represents the number of users in the
room after the user has left. This event, like `UserEntered`, is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type UserLeftEvent = {
  type: "userLeft";
  data: {
    appId: string;
    roomId: string;
    connectionId: number;
    userId: string | null;
    userInfo: Record<string, any> | null;
    leftAt: string;
    numActiveUsers: number;
  };
};

// Example
const userLeftEvent = {
  type: "userLeft",
  data: {
    appId: "my-app-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    connectionId: 4,
    userId: "a-user-id",
    userInfo: {
      name: "John Doe",
    },
    leftAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    numActiveUsers: 7,
  },
};
```

#### StorageUpdatedEvent

Storage is updated when a user writes to storage. This event is throttled at
five minutes and, as such, may not be triggered for every write. The `updatedAt`
field is the time of the last write.

For example, if a user writes to storage at 1:00pm, the `storageUpdatedEvent`
event will be triggered shortly after. If the user writes to storage again at
1:01pm, the `storageUpdatedEvent` event will be triggered 5 minutes after the
first event was sent, around 1:05pm.

```ts
// Schema
type StorageUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "storageUpdated";
  data: {
    roomId: string;
    appId: string;
    updatedAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const storageUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "storageUpdated",
  data: {
    appId: "my-app-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    updatedAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

### Endpoints

An endpoint is a URL whose purpose is to receive event messages and trigger a
task based on the message payload. The only criterion for creating an endpoint
is that it must be one that you control.

### Use Cases

Before webhooks, if you wanted to update an internal data based on Liveblocks'
state, you would need to set up a cron job to poll the
[rooms API](https://development.liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints)
for recurrent updates. With webhooks, you can now subscribe to the events you
are interested in, and be alerted of the change when it happens. Powerful ways
to leverage webhooks with Liveblocks include:

- Storage Synchronization between room(s) and an internal database
- Alerting the client when a user leaves or enters a room
- Notifying the client if maximum concurrency has been reached

## Setup

### Creating an endpoint

Creating endpoints is simple, and is done from within the webhooks dashboard for
your project.

Before sending events, you should disable CSRF protection for the endpoint if it
is enabled by default, and use the steps outlined in the Security Section to
ensure the validity of the message.

### Subscribing to events

Each endpoint you provide in the webhooks dashboard listens to all events by
default but can be easily configured to only listen to a subset by updating the
Message Filtering section during endpoint creation. The subscribed events can be
edited later in the Endpoints Overview.

### Replaying events

If your service is unreachable, retries will automatically be attempted. If your
service incurs considerable downtime (over 10 hours), you can replay individual
messages from the Endpoints portion of the dashboard by clicking the kebab menu
on an individual message, or you can opt to bulk replay events by clicking the
main menu and selecting "Replay Failed Messages."

    <source src="/images/docs/webhooks/replay-events.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

Each message is attempted based on the following schedule, where each period is
started following the failure of the preceding attempt:

- Immediately
- 5 seconds
- 5 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 2 hours
- 5 hours
- 10 hours
- 10 hours (in addition to the previous)

If an endpoint is removed or disabled, delivery attempts to the endpoint will be
disabled as well.

For example, an attempt that fails three times before eventually succeeding will
be delivered roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds following the first attempt.

## Security

Webhooks can generate security holes, but verification can mitigate this risk.
When you verify your webhooks, you protect against man-in-the-middle, CSRF, and
replay attacks. Because of this, the importance of verification cannot be
understated and should be considered paramount in your integration.

Here's how to validate a webhook message:

#### 1. Construct the signed content

The content to sign is composed by concatenating the id, timestamp and payload
of the request, separated by the full-stop character (`.`). In code, it will
look something like:

```ts
const crypto = require("crypto");

// webhookId comes from the `webhook-id` header
// webhookTimestamp comes from the `webhook-timestamp` header
// body is the request body
signedContent = `${webhookId}.${webhookTimestamp}.${body}`;
```

#### 2. Generate the signature

Liveblocks uses an HMAC with SHA-256 to sign its webhooks.

So to calculate the expected signature, you should HMAC the `signedContent` from
above using the base64 portion of your signing secret (this is the part after
the `whsec_` prefix) as the key. For example, given the secret
`whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw` you will want to use
`MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw`.

For example, this is how you can calculate the signature in Node.js:

```ts
// Your endpoint's signing secret
const secret = "whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw";

// Need to base64 decode the secret
const secretBytes = new Buffer(secret.split("_")[1], "base64");
// This is the signature you will compare against the signature header
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", secretBytes)
  .update(signedContent)
  .digest("base64");
```

#### 3. Validate the signature

This generated signature should match one of the ones sent in the
`webhook-signature` header.

The webhook-signature header is composed of a list of space delimited signatures
and their corresponding version identifiers. The signature list is most commonly
of length one. Though there could be any number of signatures. For example:

```
v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE= v1,bm9ldHUjKzFob2VudXRob2VodWUzMjRvdWVvdW9ldQo= v2,MzJsNDk4MzI0K2VvdSMjMTEjQEBAQDEyMzMzMzEyMwo=
```

Make sure to remove the version prefix and delimiter (e.g. `v1,`) before
verifying the signature.

Please note that to compare the signatures it's recommended to use a
constant-time string comparison method in order to prevent timing attacks.

#### 4. Verify the timestamp

As mentioned above, Liveblocks also sends the timestamp of the attempt in the
`webhook-timestamp` header. You should compare this timestamp against your
system timestamp and make sure it's within your tolerance in order to prevent
timestamp attacks.
