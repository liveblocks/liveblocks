A quick overview of the concepts used in Liveblocks Notifications.

## Inbox Notifications

In Liveblocks Notifications, everything revolves around _inbox notifications_.
Each user can receive these notifications, and a list of them can be rendered in
your application to create a notification tray. Inbox notifications can be sent
either automatically by other Liveblocks products, or manually by calling a
function on the server.

A user’s inbox notifications can be retrieved by a
[React hook](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useInboxNotifications) or
[individually on your server](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-users-userId-inboxNotifications-inboxNotificationId),
which is helpful after receiving a
[notification webhook event](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent). Here’s
an example of an inbox notification object for a custom notification.

```ts
{
  id: "in_sfj29g...",
  kind: "$myCustomNotification",
  subjectId: "myCustomId_dxs9s0",
  readAt: Date <Fri Dec 16 2023 15:16:25 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)>,
  notifiedAt: Date <Fri Dec 15 2023 14:15:22 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)>,
  activities: [
    { myCustomProperty: "myCustomValue" },
  ]
}
```

To build a notification tray, you can use a combination of
[default components](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/default-components)
and [hooks](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/hooks).

## Project-based

Inbox notifications are
[project-based](/docs/concepts/how-liveblocks-works#Projects), which means that
a user can receive notifications that were sent from other
[rooms](/docs/concepts/how-liveblocks-works#Rooms). This differs to other
Liveblocks products which are room-based, and rely on users inhabiting the same
space.

<Figure>

    alt="Notification rooms"
    width={1344}
    height={896}
  />
</Figure>

Project-based components require only
[`LiveblocksProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProvider)
in React, which is different to other room-based Liveblocks products which also
require [`RoomProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RoomProvider).

## Notification kinds

Each inbox notification has a `kind`, and this represents the type of
notification it is. A `kind` is either a custom string prefixed with `$` (e.g.
`$myCustomNotification`) when sending a custom notification, or a predefined
string set by Liveblocks (e.g. `thread`) when it’s sent by a Liveblocks product.

### Custom notifications

A custom notification is a notification that you specify yourself, and can
contain any content.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/notifications/custom-notification-both.jpg"
    alt="Thread"
    width={1344}
    height={896}
  />
</Figure>

Custom notifications can be sent using
[`liveblocks.triggerInboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-inbox-notifications-trigger)
on the server, and the `kind` must always begin with a `$`, for example
`$myCustomNotification`.

When you trigger an inbox notification, you pass the activity data, which
represents the events that happened. If you’d like to update an existing inbox
notification when a new activity happens, you can
[configure the custom notification to use batching](#notification-batching).

### Collaboration notifications

[Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments) can send `thread` notifications
for you automatically, notifying you of events such as a mention, or a new reply
in a thread you’re participating in. Additionally,
[text editors](/docs/ready-made-features/multiplayer-editing) can send
`textMention` notifications when users are mentioned inside the editor.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/notifications/notifications-inbox.jpg"
    alt="Thread"
    width={1344}
    height={896}
  />
</Figure>

These are enabled by default and the notification `kind` names are `thread` and
`textMention`. Threads and mentions leverage Notifications behind-the-scenes to
keep track of unread comments so viewing a thread will also mark its inbox
notification as read, and vice versa.

If you use the default
[`Thread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Thread) component, it will
automatically handle marking threads as read when they are viewed and show
unread indicators when there are unread comments in threads you are
participating in.

## Notification batching

Batching allows you to group multiple activities into a single notification.
This is useful for reducing the number of notifications that are sent to the
user, and can be enabled on custom notification kinds. It’s always enabled for
Liveblocks `thread` notifications, where new comments in a thread are grouped
into a single notification.

Within the “Notifications” page in the [dashboard](/dashboard), you can add a
custom kind and enable batching. When it’s enabled, triggering an inbox
notification activity for a specific `subjectId`, will update the existing inbox
notification instead of creating a new one.

      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>

An inbox notification can have up to 50 activities, if you exceed this number, a
new inbox notification will be created. Liveblocks `textMention` notifications
are never batched.

## Notification channels

You can also send notifications on other channels, such as email or Slack,
letting users know when they’ve missed in-app notifications. Using our dashboard
and hooks you can allow users to set their own notification settings.

    width={1344}
    height={896}

</Figure>

There are default channel types for email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Web Push.
Each channel works the same, but you can enable different settings for each and
use them differently. Learn more about notification channels in our
[email notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/email-notifications)
page.

## Permissions

### Access tokens

When using [access token authentication](/docs/authentication/access-token),
Liveblocks disregards the permissions specified in the tokens and returns all
notifications created for the user. Consequently, a user will receive
notifications for mentions in comments within rooms they do not have access to.

For greater control over notification permissions, we recommend utilizing
[ID tokens](/docs/authentication/id-token).

### ID token

When using [ID token authentication](/docs/authentication/id-token), Liveblocks
reads the permissions set on the room, and uses these to deliver notifications
that the user is authorized to view.

## Email notifications

It’s possible to send email notifications to your users, listing all their
unread inbox notifications using a [webhook](/docs/platform/webhooks) event that
Liveblocks provides. Learn more about
[email notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/email-notifications).
