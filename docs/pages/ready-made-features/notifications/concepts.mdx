A quick overview of the concepts used in Liveblocks Notifications.

## Inbox Notifications

In Liveblocks Notifications, everything resolves around _inbox notifications_.
Each user can receive these notifications, and a list of them can be rendered in
your application to create a notification tray. Inbox notifications can be sent
either automatically by other Liveblocks products, or manually by calling a
function on the server.

A user’s inbox notifications can be retrieved by a
[React hook](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useInboxNotifications) or
[individually on your server](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-users-userId-inboxNotifications-inboxNotificationId),
which is helpful after receiving a
[notification webhook event](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent). Here’s
an example of an inbox notification object for a custom notification.

```ts
{
  id: "in_sfj29g...",
  kind: "$myCustomNotification",
  subjectId: "myCustomId_dxs9s0",
  readAt: Date <Fri Dec 16 2023 15:16:25 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)>,
  notifiedAt: Date <Fri Dec 15 2023 14:15:22 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)>,
  activityData: {
    myCustomProperty: "myCustomValue",
  }
}
```

To build a notification tray, you can use a combination of
[default components](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/default-components)
and [hooks](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/hooks).

## Project-based

Inbox notifications are
[project-based](/docs/concepts/how-liveblocks-works#Projects), which means that
a user can receive notifications that were sent from other
[rooms](/docs/concepts/how-liveblocks-works#Rooms). This differs to other
Liveblocks products which are room-based, and rely on users inhabiting the same
space.

    height={896}

Project-based components require only
[`LiveblocksProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProvider)
in React, which is different to other room-based Liveblocks products which also
require [`RoomProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RoomProvider).

## Notification kinds

Each inbox notification has a `kind`, and this represents the type of
notification it is. A `kind` is either a custom string prefixed with `$` (e.g.
`$myCustomNotification`) when sending a custom notification, or specific string
set by Liveblocks (e.g. `thread`) when it’s sent by a Liveblocks product.

### Custom notifications

A custom notification is a notification that you specify yourself, and can
contain any content.

<Figure>

    src="/assets/notifications/custom-notification-both.jpg"
    alt="Thread"
    width={1344}
    height={896}
  />
</Figure>

Custom notifications can be sent using
[`liveblocks.triggerInboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-inbox-notifications-trigger)
on the server, and the `kind` must always begin with a `$`, for example
`$myCustomNotification`.

### Liveblocks notifications

[Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments) can send `thread` notifications
for you automatically, notifying you of events such as a mention, or a new reply
in a thread you’re participating in.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/notifications/notifications-inbox.jpg"
    alt="Thread"
    width={1344}
    height={896}
  />
</Figure>

This is enabled by default and the notification `kind` is `thread`. Threads
leverage Notifications behind-the-scenes to keep track of unread comments so
viewing a thread will also mark its inbox notification as read, and vice versa.

If you use the default
[`Thread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Thread) component, it will
automatically handle marking threads as read when they are viewed and show
unread indicators when there are unread comments in threads you are
participating in.

## Permissions

### Access tokens

When using [access token authentication](/docs/authentication/access-token),
Liveblocks disregards the permissions specified in the tokens and returns all
notifications created for the user. Consequently, a user will receive
notifications for mentions in comments within rooms they do not have access to.

For greater control over notification permissions, we recommend utilizing
[ID tokens](/docs/authentication/id-token).

### ID token

When using [ID token authentication](/docs/authentication/id-token), Liveblocks
reads the permissions set on the room, and uses these to deliver notifications
that the user is authorized to view.

## Email notifications

It’s possible to send email notifications to your users, listing all their
unread inbox notifications using a [webhook](/docs/platform/webhook) event that
Liveblocks provides. Learn more about
[email notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/email-notifications).
