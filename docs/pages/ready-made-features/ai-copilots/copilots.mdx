AI Copilots provides a default copilot for testing, but you should define a
custom copilot in the [Liveblocks dashboard](/dashboard) for further development
and production, This allows you to configure your AI model, system prompt,
back-end knowledge, and more.

## Creating a copilot

To create a copilot, open the [Liveblocks dashboard](/dashboard), select a
project and click on the “AI Copilots” page. Click on the “Create copilot”
button, and fill in the required fields.

### Get your API key

Copilots use API keys provided by your AI provider, which can be created and
copied on their respective websites. Out of the box, we support
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys),
[Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), and
[Google](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys), but, you can use other
OpenAI-compatible APIs, such as [Groq](https://groq.com/api-keys) and
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys).

## Add the copilot to your application

To use the new copilot in your application, copy your copilot ID from the
dashboard.

Paste the copilot ID into
[`AiChat`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#AiChat) and
[`useSendAiMessage`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useSendAiMessage) to
start using it.

```tsx
<AiChat
  chatId="my-chat-id"
  // +++
  copilotId="co_tUYtNctLAtUIAAIZBc1Zk"
  // +++
/>
```

```tsx
useSendAiMessage("my-chat-id", {
  // +++
  copilotId: "co_tUYtNctLAtUIAAIZBc1Zk",
  // +++
});
```

## Configuring your copilot

Within the “General” tab you can configure a number of settings for your
copilot. Settings slightly differ between providers though the "system prompt"
is always the most important setting:

### System prompt

The system prompt defines the behavior of the copilot, for example:

```text title="System prompt"
You're a helpful assistant that can answer questions and help with tasks.
```

You can create more complex system prompts by using
[Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

```text title="System prompt"
# Role and objective

You're a helpful assistant that can answer questions and help with tasks.

## Instructions

- Always help the user as best you can.
- Always use markdown formatting in your responses.
- If you don't know the answer, tell the user to contact support.

## Examples

User: How do I log in?
Assistant: Navigate to the [login page](/login) and enter your email.

User: What's the weather in Tokyo?
Assistant: I don't know the answer to that question, please contact support.
```

### When should AI use knowledge?

This setting determines when AI will search back-end knowledge before
responding.

```text title="When should AI use knowledge?"
Whenever the user asks a question about code.
```

You can also write a more complex prompt, giving knowledge a name, which then
allows you to refer to it in your system prompt. This can help reinforce AI
behavior.

```text title="When should AI use knowledge?"
Whenever the user asks a question about code.

// +++
This is your "knowledge base".
// +++
```

```text title="System prompt"
## Instructions

// +++
- When a user asks about React, searching your "knowledge base" is required.
// +++
...
```

## Adding back-end knowledge

Under the “Knowledge” tab you can add back-end knowledge to your copilot.
Knowledge can be submitted as web pages or files, and your AI chat can query
this knowledge when responding, allowing it to intelligently answer questions or
perform tasks.

  />

You can submit a whole website/sitemap for crawling, a single page, or PDF/image
files. Crawled knowledge is not updated, and to update it, it must be
resubmitted programmatically or via the dashboard.

## Modifying copilots programmatically

You aren’t limited to creating copilots from the dashboard—you can also create
and modify copilots programmatically, allowing users or teams in your app to
have their own individual copilots.

```ts
const copilot = await liveblocks.createAiCopilot({
  name: "My AI Assistant",
  systemPrompt: "You're a helpful assistant that can answer questions.",
  provider: "openai",
  providerModel: "gpt-4",
  providerApiKey: "sk-...",
});
```

This is made possible using the
[Liveblocks Node.js client](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#AI-Copilots) and
[REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#AI), where a number of APIs
are available for managing copilots and knowledge sources.
