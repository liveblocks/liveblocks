Knowledge allows you to provide context to your AI so it can understand your
application’s state, content, and domain-specific information, making responses
more relevant and accurate. There are two different knowledge types—_front-end
knowledge_, ideal for adding small pieces of contextual information, and
_back-end knowledge_, designed for larger datasets such as entire websites and
lengthy PDFs.

## Front-end knowledge

Front-end knowledge is data that’s passed to your AI from the browser through
[React](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RegisterAiKnowledge). This is most
useful for passing contextual, user-specific, information, for example:

- **User info**: The user’s local time, date, location, and language.
- **Account info**: The user’s projects and which payment plan they’re on.
- **Page info**: Which URL the user is viewing and the content of the current
  document.

### How it works [#front-end-knowledge-how-it-works]

Front-end knowledge is string or JSON-serializable data that is passed to the AI
with every message the user sends. The AI reads all front-end knowledge before
responding. It’s easy to reach AI provider token limits with this approach, so
limit your front-end knowledge to relatively small amounts of data, not multiple
pages of text.

Because front-end knowledge is simply passed along with every message, and is
never specifically queried, there front-end knowledge is not displayed in the UI
when its used.

### Adding front-end knowledge

You can add front-end knowledge to your chat by using the
[`RegisterAiKnowledge`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RegisterAiKnowledge)
component anywhere in your application.

```tsx
import { RegisterAiKnowledge } from "@liveblocks/react";
import { AiChat } from "@liveblocks/react-ui";

function Chat() {
  return (
    <>
      <AiChat chatId="my-chat-id" />
      // +++
      <RegisterAiKnowledge
        description="The current user's payment plan"
        value={{ name: "Advanced Plan", expires: "2026-01-01" }}
      />
      // +++
    </>
  );
}
```

After adding this, the AI will understand that the user is on the Advanced Plan
and be able to answer questions on it, for example:

> User: _What's my current plan?_
>
> Assistant: _You're on the Advanced Plan, it expires on January 1st, 2026._

### Combine front-end knowledge with tools

You can combine front-end knowledge with
[tools](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/tools) to create a AI assistant’s
that can take actions. For example, say you have a document on the current page.
You can use knowledge to share the document content with the AI, then create a
tool that allows AI to edit the document.

```tsx
import { RegisterAiKnowledge } from "@liveblocks/react";
import { AiChat } from "@liveblocks/react-ui";
import { RegisterAiTool } from "@liveblocks/react";
import { defineAiTool } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { useState } from "react";

function Document() {
  // +++
  const [document, setDocument] = useState("Hello world");
  // +++

  return (
    <>
      <AiChat chatId="my-chat-id" />
      <RegisterAiKnowledge
        description="The current document"
        // +++
        value={document}
        // +++
      />
      <RegisterAiTool
        name="edit-document"
        tool={defineAiTool()({
          description: "Edit the document's text",
          parameters: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {},
          },
        })}
      />
      <RegisterAiTool
        name="edit-document"
        tool={defineAiTool()({
          description: "Edit the document's text",
          parameters: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              text: { type: "string" },
            },
          },
          execute: ({ args }) => {
            // +++
            setDocument(args.text);
            // +++
            return { data: {}, description: "Document updated" };
          },
        })}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

Learn about more ways to use it in our documentation under
[`RegisterAiKnowledge`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RegisterAiKnowledge).

## Back-end knowledge

Back-end knowledge is data that’s passed to your AI from the server, through
your
[copilot](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/copilots#Adding-back-end-knowledge).
You can submit PDF/image files, web pages, or entire websites which will be
crawled and indexed. This is most useful for passing large amounts of
information, for example:

- **Knowledge bases**: Documentation, FAQs, and support tickets.
- **Domain-specific data**: Detailed information that your AI must understand.
- **Documents**: Submit PDF or image scans of reports, contracts, and invoices.

### How it works [#back-end-knowledge-how-it-works]

Back-end knowledge uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) search, and is
triggered by a hidden tool call, meaning the AI will search through its back-end
knowledge when it feels its relevant. You can define
[when AI should use back-endknowledge](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/copilots#When-should-AI-use-knowledge)
in your copilot settings, and AI will understand what should trigger a back-end
knowldege query.

The AI will rewrite your query, and may even run multiple queries in a row, each
of which will be displayed in the
[`AiChat`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#AiChat) UI as a search.

### Adding back-end knowledge through the dashboard

After
[creating a copilot](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/copilots#Creating-a-copilot)
in the [dashboard](/dashboard), you can navigate to the “Knowledge” tab to add
back-end knowledge. Select which type of knowledge you’d like to submit, and
enter your URLs or upload your files.

    height={409}
    quality={100}
  />

Make sure to use your copilot ID in
[`AiChat`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#AiChat) and
[`useSendAiMessage`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useSendAiMessage) to
use the knowledge in your application.

### Adding back-end knowledge programmatically

You aren’t limited to modifying knowledge through the dashboard—you can also add
copilot knowledge programmatically, allowing users or teams in your app to have
their own individual knowledge bases.

```ts
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

// +++
const { id } = await liveblocks.createWebKnowledgeSource({
  copilotId: "co_abc123...",
  url: "https://example.com",
  type: "crawl",
});
// +++
```

This is made possible using the
[Liveblocks Node.js client](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#AI-Copilots) and
[REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#AI), where a number of APIs
are available for managing copilots and knowledge sources.

- [`createFileKnowledgeSource`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#create-file-knowledge-source)
- [`getKnowledgeSources`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-knowledge-sources)
