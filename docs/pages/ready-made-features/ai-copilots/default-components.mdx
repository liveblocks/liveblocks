The default components included in AI Copilots are a great way to start building
AI into your application. With these components you can render advanced AI
chats, that understand your application state, modify it with actions, and
render custom in-chat components.

- Fully styled AI chat components, with an optional dark mode.
- Pass in knowledge, add actions, and render custom components.
- Customize through CSS variables and class names.
- Localize and modify strings with overrides.

## AiChat

The [`AiChat`][] component renders an AI chat, with a chat history, a composer
for adding new messages, and a toolbar for adding AI actions.

{/* TODO AiChat image */}

### Usage

Get started by importing the component, and passing in a unique chat ID.

```tsx
import { AiChat } from "@liveblocks/react-ui";

function Component() {
  return <AiChat chatId="my-chat-id" />;
}
```

This will render an AI chat on the page, with a chat history, and a composer for
adding new messages. Each chat is stored permanently, and can be accessed again
later.

{/* TODO list everything you can do with it */}

## AiTool

The [`AiTool`][] component renders a button that can be used to add an AI action
to the chat.

{/* TODO AiTool image */}

### Usage

{/* TODO usage */}

## Customization

Itâ€™s possible to style and localize the default components:

- Import dark mode styles.
- Modify the style with CSS variables and class names.
- Use overrides to change default text used in the components.

{/* TODO page */}
