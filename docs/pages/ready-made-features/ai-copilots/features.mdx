Liveblocks AI Copilots provides customizable UI components that let your users
interact with AI in a way that feels native to your product. Unlike basic chat
widgets, Copilots are context-aware, collaborative, and capable of performing
real tasks—such as editing content, navigating your app, or answering
product-specific questions. They’re built for React developers, work with your
chosen LLM, and integrate directly into your existing UI using flexible APIs and
fully themeable components.

## Persistent chats [#persistent-chats]

When building a chat interface, it’s important to save the chat history so that
the user can continue the conversation from where they left off. All chats and
messages are stored automatically by Liveblocks, and each user has
[their own set of chats](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/hooks#List-a-user's-chats).
No database is required, and messages are streamed into the chat in realtime
using WebSockets.

<Figure>
  <Image

    alt="An example showing a list of different chats, each with custom metadata, and a create new chat button."
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

Each page of your application can have multiple different chats, and it’s easy
to switch between them, much like in ChatGPT. Each chat has a unique name, and
can be given custom metadata, for example a custom title, description, tags, or
anything you like.

### Automatic synchronization

When the page refreshes, each user’s previous chats will load for them, and can
be continued. If a user has your app open in multiple browser tabs, each tab
will correctly display chats, and update in real-time.

## Tools [#tools]

[Tools](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/tools) are a way to allow AI to
make actions, modify your application state, interact with your front end, or
render custom content with your own components. You can use them to extend the
capabilities of AI Copilots beyond simple text-based interactions. For example,
you may have tools that create new documents in your app, automatically fill in
form data, invite members to a project, or anything else you like.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/document-changes.png"
    alt="An example of a document with a chat app in the corner. The chat has run a tool, and has edited the document."
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

Tools are defined in your code, and are executed and/or rendered when the AI
requests to use them.

### Tools work with our other products

Through tools, you can integrate AI Copilots into our other products, such as
[Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments),
[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications), and
[Sync Datastore](/docs/platform/sync-datastore). For example, you can allow AI
to add comments to your application, send notifications to other users, or add
shapes to a collaborative drawing app.

## Knowledge [#knowledge]

It’s simple to
[add knowledge and context to your AI](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/knowledge),
so that it understands the current document or page. You can submit webpages and
files, such as documentation, that the copilot will deeply internalize, allowing
it to reply intelligently. Addidtionally, certain models can also search the
web.

<Figure>
  <Image

    alt="An example of a document containing numbers. The AI chat in the corner has been asked about the numbers, and understands the context of the document."

## Ready-made UI [#ready-made-ui]

Liveblocks AI Copilots includes a set of styled UI components that can be used
to add an AI chat interface to your application. Messages are streamed in
realtime.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/floating-chat.png"
    alt="A screenshot of the ready-made chat component, with messages and AI suggestion buttons."
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

We also provide [a number of hooks](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/hooks)
that allow you to extend your chat, or create fully custom chat interfaces.

## Custom chat components [#custom-chat-components]

Inside your chat, you can register custom React components that the AI can
choose to render as a response. For example, if your app contains charts, AI can
choose to render a custom chart component instead of a message. If you have
multiple components, AI can choose which one to render.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/custom-component.png"
    alt="An example of the AI rendering a custom chat component instead of a message. It's a graph component."
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

These components can be fully interactive, for example this chart component
could have a button that lets you save it, and add it to a project.

## Text editor toolbar

Using our
[Text Editor integration for Tiptap](/docs/ready-made-features/text-editor/tiptap),
we provide an AI toolbar that can be added to your collaborative text editor.
This toolbar allows you to select text, and ask AI to make changes for you, for
example fixing typos, and creating new paragraphs.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/ai-toolbar.png"
    alt="An example of the AI toolbar in a text editor, with an 'Ask Copilot' button."
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

Learn more about this React component under
[`AiToolbar`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-tiptap#AiToolbar)

## Manage AI copilots [#manage-ai-copilots]

The [Liveblocks dashboard](/dashboard) allows you to create, configure, and
manage your AI copilots, each of which can be used in different parts of your
application. You can select your [AI provider](#supported-ai-providers) (e.g.
OpenAI, Anthropic), specify a system prompt, and pass in your secret key to get
it working.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/dashboard-manage-copilot.png"
    alt="A screenshot of our dashboard, showing the settings for an AI copilot."
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

You can also fine-tune how each copilot interacts with users by adjusting each
model’s settings, which are passed through directly to the AI provider. These
can influence its creativity, consistency, and the safety of generated content.
Each copilot can be configured independently, and tested live in the dashboard.

## Supported AI providers [#supported-ai-providers]

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/providers.png"
    alt="We support different AI providers"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

In our dashboard, you can create, configure, and manage copilots powered by
different AI providers, each with different settings. The following providers
are supported out-of-the-box:

- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- Other OpenAI-compatible APIs
- Google Gemini

### Reasoning models

Reasoning models are supported by our built-in components, allowing models to
show their thought processes.

## Coming soon [#coming-soon]

## One-off prompts [#one-off-prompts]

One-off prompts are a way to add assorted AI features to your app, specifically
features that don’t require a chat, such as an AI button on a page.
[Tools](#tools) and [context](#knowledge) are supported, allowing AI to interact
with your application, and understand its state. An example use case for a
one-off prompt is a button that uses AI to fill in a form.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/one-off-prompts.png"
    alt="An example use for a one-off prompt, an AI button that fills in a table for you."
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

### Chat attachments

Upload files into the chat, which AI can modify, or use for extra context. These
files can be images, PDFs, text documents, or any file type your AI provider can
understand. Files are automatically stored by Liveblocks.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/attachment.png"
    alt="A zoomed-in screenshot of a chat with an uploaded attachment, ready to send."
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

### MCP server integration

MCP is a protocol for running AI agents on a server, allowing you to make
various back ends calls to different services. In future, AI Copilots will
support this.

### Additional providers

We will be investigating additional providers, such as LangGraph, Crew AI,
Bedrock, and Vertex AI. If there is a specific provider you’d like us to
support, please [book a demo with our team](/contact/sales) and let us know more
information in the text box.
