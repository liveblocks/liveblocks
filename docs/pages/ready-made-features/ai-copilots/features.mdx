Liveblocks AI Copilots allows you to add a variety of AI experiences to your
application, such as AI chat interfaces and toolbars, that can interact with
your application and modify its state. For example, if your product contained a
calendar, you could enable AI to automatically book meetings for your users,
directly from a chat.

## One-off prompts [#one-off-prompts]

One-off prompts are a way to add assorted AI features to your app, specifcally
features that don’t require a chat, such as an AI button on a page.
[Actions](#actions) and [context](#context) are supported, allowing AI to
interact with your application, and understand its state. An example use case
for a one-off prompt is a button that uses AI to fill in a form.

## Persistent chats [#persistent-chats]

When building a chat interface, it’s important to save the chat history so that
the user can continue the conversation from where they left off. All chats and
messages are stored automatically by Liveblocks, and each user has their own set
of chats. No database is required, and messages are streamed into the chat in
realtime using WebSockets.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/multiple-chats.png"
    alt="A list of chats, with a create new chat button"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

Each page of your application can have multiple different chats, and it’s easy
to switch between them, much like in ChatGPT. Each chat has a unique name, and
can be given custom metadata, for example a custom title, description, tags, or
anything you like.

### Edit messages

It’s possible to go back to previous messages and start editing from there,
allowing users to start again from a certain point in the chat.

### Automatic synchronization

When the page refreshes, each user’s previous chats will load for them, and can
be continued. If a user has your app open in multiple browser tabs, each tab
will correctly display chats, and update in real-time.

## Actions [#actions]

Actions are a way to allow AI to modify your application state and interact with
your front end. You can use them to extend the capabilities of AI Copilots
beyond simple text-based interactions. For example, you may have actions that
create new documents in your app, automatically fill in form data, search the
web for data, or anything else you like.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/document-changes.png"
    alt="A chat with actions"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

Actions are defined in your code, and are executed when the AI requests to use
them.

### Actions work with our other products

Through actions, you can integrate AI Copilots into our other products, such as
[Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments),
[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications), and
[Sync Datastore](/docs/platform/sync-datastore). For example, you can allow AI
to add comments to your application, send notifications to other users, or add
shapes to a collaborative drawing app.

## Context [#context]

It’s simple to add context to your AI, so that is understands the current
document or page.

    alt="A chat with context from a document"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

### Attachments

Additionally, you can upload files into the chat, which AI can modify, or use
for extra context. These files can be images, PDFs, text documents, or any file
type your AI provider can understand. Files are automatically stored by
Liveblocks.

## Ready-made UI [#ready-made-ui]

Liveblocks AI Copilots includes a set of styled UI components that can be used
to add an AI chat interface to your application. Messages are streamed in
realtime.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/floating-chat.png"
    alt="An empty chat component, floating in the corner"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

We provide a number of hooks that allow you to create your own custom chat
components too, such as `useChats` and `useMessages`.

## Custom chat components [#custom-chat-components]

Inside your chat, you can register custom React components that the AI can
choose to render as a response. For example, if your app contains playlists, AI
can choose to render a custom playlist component instead of a message. If you
have multiple components, AI can choose which one to render.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/custom-component.png"
    alt="A custom calendar chat component"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

These components can be fully interactive, for example a playlist component
could have a play button that the AI can use to play a song.

## Text editor toolbar

Using our
[Text Editor integration for Tiptap](/docs/ready-made-features/text-editor/tiptap),
we provide an AI toolbar that can be added to your collaborative text editor.
This toolbar allows you to select text, and ask AI to make changes for you, for
example fixing typos, and creating new paragraphs.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/ai-toolbar.png"
    alt="Text editor AI toolbar"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

Learn more about this React component under
[`AiToolbar`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-tiptap#AiToolbar)

## Manage AI copilots [#manage-ai-copilots]

The [Liveblocks dashboard](/dashboard) allows you to create, configure, and
manage your AI copilots, each of which can be used in different parts of your
application. You can select your [AI provider](#supported-ai-providers) (e.g.
OpenAI, Anthropic), specify a system prompt, and pass in your secret key to get
it working.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/dashboard-manage-copilot.png"
    alt="Manage copilot settings from the dashboard"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

You can also fine-tune how each copilot interacts with users by adjusting each
model’s settings, which are passed through directly to the AI provider. These
can influence its creativity, consistency, and the safety of generated content.
Each copilot can be configured independently, and tested live in the dashboard.

## Supported AI providers [#supported-ai-providers]

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/providers.png"
    alt="We support different AI providers"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

In our dashboard, you can create, configure, and manage copilots powered by
different AI providers, each with different settings. The following providers
are supported out-of-the-box:

- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- Other OpenAI-compatible APIs
- Google Gemini

### Additional providers

Additional providers can also be used, with our custom abstraction layer, such
as LangGraph, Crew AI, Bedrock, and Vertex AI. More providers will be given
first-party support in future.

### Reasoning models

Reasoning models are supported by our built-in components, allowing models to
show their thought processes.

## Coming soon [#coming-soon]

### RAG support

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that allows AI to retrieve
information from a knowledge base and use it to generate responses. In future,
AI Copilots will use this to support:

- Contextual chat history retrieval
- Knowledge base integration
- Document context awareness

### MCP server integration

MCP is a protocol for running AI agents on a server, allowing you to make
various back ends calls to different services. In future, AI Copilots will
support this.
