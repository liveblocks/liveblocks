Liveblocks AI Copilots allows you to add a variety of AI experiences to your
application, such as AI chat interfaces and toolbars, that can interact with
your application and modify its state. For example, if your product contained a
calendar, you could enable AI to automatically book meetings for your users,
directly from a chat.

## Persistent chats

When building a chat interface, it’s important to save the chat history so that
the user can continue the conversation from where they left off. All chats and
messages are stored automatically by Liveblocks, and each user has their own set
of chats. No database is required, and messages are streamed into the chat in
realtime using WebSockets.

### Multiple chats with metadata

Each page of your application can have multiple different chats, and it’s easy
to switch between them, much like in ChatGPT. Each chat has a unique name, and
can be given custom metadata, for example a custom title, description, tags, or
anything you like.

</Figure>

### Branch into new chats

It’s possible to go back to previous messages and create a new chat from there,
as messages can be branched. Essentially, each message can be thought of as a
branch in a tree, and you can choose to continue down the same branch, or create
a new one at any time. This is helpful for duplicating chats, or going back and
revising your previous responses.

  />
</Figure>

### Automatic synchronization

When the page refreshes, each user’s previous chats will load for them, and can
be continued. If a user has your app open in multiple browser tabs, each tab
will correctly display chats, and update in real-time.

### Stateless mode

If you don’t need to save chat history, you can use stateless mode instead. This
is ideal for creating temporary AI interactions, that don’t need to be stored.

## Actions

Actions are a way to allow AI to modify your application state and interact with
your front end. You can use them to extend the capabilities of AI Copilots
beyond simple text-based interactions. For example, you may have actions that
create new documents in your app, automatically fill in form data, search the
web for data, or anything else you like.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/document-changes.png"
    alt="A chat with actions"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

Actions are defined in your code, and are executed when the AI requests to use
them.

### Actions work with our other products

Through actions, you can integrate AI Copilots into our other products, such as
[Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments),
[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications), and
[Sync Datastore](/docs/platform/sync-datastore). For example, you can allow AI
to add comments to your application, send notifications to other users, or add
shapes to a collaborative drawing app.

## Context

It’s simple to add context to your AI, so that is understands the current
document or page.

    alt="A chat with context from a document"
    width={768}

  />
</Figure>

### Attachments

Additionally, you can upload files into the chat, which AI can modify, or use
for extra context. These files can be images, PDFs, text documents, or any file
type your AI provider can understand. Files are automatically stored by
Liveblocks.

## Ready-made UI

Liveblocks AI Copilots includes a set of styled UI components that can be used
to add an AI chat interface to your application. Messages are streamed in
realtime.

    alt="An empty chat component, floating in the corner"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

We provide a number of hooks that allow you to create your own custom chat
components too, such as `useChats` and `useMessages`.

## Custom chat components

Inside your chat, you can register custom React components that the AI can
choose to render as a response. For example, if your app contains playlists, AI
can choose to render a custom playlist component instead of a message. If you
have multiple components, AI can choose which one to render.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/custom-component.png"
    alt="A custom calendar chat component"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

These components can be fully interactive, for example a playlist component
could have a play button that the AI can use to play a song.

## Text editor toolbar

Using our
[Text Editor integration for Tiptap](/docs/ready-made-features/text-editor/tiptap),
we provide an AI toolbar that can be added to your collaborative text editor.
This toolbar allows you to select text, and ask AI to make changes for you, for
example fixing typos, and creating new paragraphs.

[`AiToolbar`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-tiptap#AiToolbar)

## Supported AI providers

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/ai-copilots/providers.png"
    alt="We support different AI providers"
    width={768}
    height={512}
  />
</Figure>

In our dashboard, you can configure multiple copilots powered by different AI
providers, each with different settings. The following providers are supported
out-of-the-box:

- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- Other OpenAI-compatible APIs
- Google Gemini
- LangGraph (coming soon)
- CrewAI (coming soon)

Additional providers can also be used, with our custom abstraction layer.

## Coming soon

### Advanced reasoning

In future, AI Copilots will support reasoning, allowing you to ask the AI to
reason about a situation and provide a more carefully thought out response.

### RAG support

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that allows AI to retrieve
information from a knowledge base and use it to generate responses. In future,
AI Copilots will use this to support:

- Contextual chat history retrieval
- Knowledge base integration
- Document context awareness

### MCP server integration

MCP is a protocol for running AI agents on a server, allowing you to make
various back ends calls to different services. In future, AI Copilots will
support this.

### Custom back end integration

In future, you will be able to connect to specialized AI back ends, such as
Bedrock and Vertex AI.
