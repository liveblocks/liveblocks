A quick overview of the features of AI Copilots. Learn about the
[architecture here](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/architecture).

## Overview

Liveblocks AI Copilots allows you to add a variety of AI experiences to your
application, such as AI chat interfaces and toolbars, that can interact with
your application and modify its state. For example, if your product contained a
calendar, you could enable AI to automatically book meetings for your users,
directly from a chat.

features visible in one]

## Features

- **Persistent chats**: No database is required, each user’s chats are stored
  permanently.
- **AI Actions**: Easily allow AI to interact with your application and modify
  its state.
- **Context**: Feed text and files into the AI so it understands the current
  context.
- **Ready-made UI**: Polished, easily customizable React components to add to
  your app.
- **Custom rendering**: Register React components that the AI can selectively
  render within the chat
- **Supported AI providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, LangGraph,
  CrewAI, and more.

## Persistant chats

When building a chat interface, it's important to save the chat history so that
the user can continue the conversation from where they left off. All chats and
messages are stored automatically by Liveblocks, and each user has their own set
of chats. No database is required.

### Multiple chats with metadata

Each page of your application can have multiple different chats, and it’s easy
to switch between them, much like in ChatGPT. Each chat has a unique name, and
can be given custom metadata, for example a custom title, description, tags, or
anything you like.

### Branch into new chats

It’s possible to go back to previous messages and create a new chat from there,
as messages can be branched. Essentially, each message can be thought of as a
branch in a tree, and you can choose to continue down the same branch, or create
a new one at any time. This is helpful for duplicating chats, or going back and
revising your previous responses.

### Automatic synchronization

When the page refreshes, each user’s previous chats will load for them, and can
be continued. If a user has your app open in multiple browser tabs, each tab
will correctly display chats, and update in real-time.

### Stateless mode

If you don’t need to save chat history, you can use stateless mode instead. This
is ideal for creating temporary AI interactions, that don’t need to be stored.

## Actions

Actions are a way to allow AI to modify your application state and interact with
your front end. You can use them to extend the capabilities of AI Copilots
beyond simple text-based interactions. For example, you may have actions that
create new documents in your app, automatically fill in form data, search the
web for data, or anything else you like.

Actions are defined in your code, and are executed when the AI requests to use
them.

### Integrates into our other products

With actions, you can integrate AI Copilots into our other products, such as
[Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments),
[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications), and
[Sync Datastore](/docs/platform/sync-datastore). For example, you can create
actions that add comments to your application, send notifications to other
users, or add shapes to a collaborative drawing app.

current user, with a button saying "Post comment"]

## Context

It’s simple to add context to your AI, so that is understands the current
document or page.

### Attachments

Additionally, you can upload files into the chat, which AI can modify, or use
for extra context. These files can be images, PDFs, text documents, or any file
type your AI provider can understand. Files are automatically stored by
Liveblocks.

## Ready-made components

Liveblocks AI Copilots includes a set of styled UI components that can be used
to add an AI chat interface to your application. They’re made with React and
also contain a number of hooks for building custom interfaces.

## Custom chat components

You can register custom React components that the AI can choose to render within
the chat. if you have multiple components, AI can choose which one to render.

providers, each with different settings. The following providers are supported
out-of-the-box:

- Anthropic
- OpenAI (and other OpenAI-compatible APIs)
- Google Gemini
- LangGraph
- CrewAI

Additional providers can also be used, with our custom abstraction layer.
