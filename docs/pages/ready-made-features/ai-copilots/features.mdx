A quick overview of the features of AI Copilots. Learn about the
[architecture here](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots/architecture).

## Overview

Liveblocks AI Copilots allows you to add a variety of AI experiences to your
application, such as AI chat interfaces and toolbars, that can interact with
your application and modify its state. For example, if your product contained a
calendar, you could enable AI to automatically book meetings for your users,
directly from a chat.

## Persistant chats

When building a chat interface, it's important to save the chat history so that
the user can continue the conversation from where they left off. All chats and
messages are stored automatically by Liveblocks, and each user has their own set
of chats. No database is required.

### Switch between multiple chats

Each page of your application can have multiple differents chats, and it’s easy
to switch between them, much like you’d find in ChatGPT. Each chat has a unique
name, and can be given custom metadata, for example a custom title, description,
tags, or anything you like.

### Branch into new chats

It’s possible to go back to previous messages and create a new chat from there,
as messages can be branched. Essentially, each message can be thought of as a
branch in a tree, and you can choose to continue down the same branch, or create
a new one at any time. This is helpful for duplicating chats, or going back and
revising your previous responses.

### Automatic synchronization

When the page refreshes, each user’s previous chats will load for them, and can
be continued. If a user has your app open in multiple browser tabs, each tab
will correctly display chats, and update in real-time.

### Stateless mode

If you don’t need to save chat history, you can use stateless mode instead. This
is ideal for creating temporary AI interactions, that don’t need to be stored.

## Actions

Actions are a way to allow AI to modify your application state and interact with
your front end. You can use them to extend the capabilities of AI Copilots
beyond simple text-based interactions.

For example, you may have actions that create new documents in your app,
automatically fill in form data, send notification emails to users, or anything
else you like. Actions are defined in your code, and are executed when the AI
requests to use them.

## Ready-made components

Liveblocks AI Copilots includes a set of UI components that can be used to add
an AI chat interface to your application. They’re made with React and also
contain a number of hooks for building custom interfaces.

## Custom chat components

You can register custom React components that the AI can choose to render within
the chat. if you have multiple components, AI can choose which one to render.
