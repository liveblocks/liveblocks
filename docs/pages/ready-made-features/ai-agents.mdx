AI Agents let you embed AI teammates directly into your app. Agents can respond
to messages, handle @mentions, perform actions, and collaborate inside your
product—just like human users. Use a simple built-in copilot powered by any LLM,
or connect your own agent framework such as n8n or LangChain.

## Key features
