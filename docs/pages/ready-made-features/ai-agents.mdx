AI Agents let you embed AI teammates directly into your app. Agents can respond
to messages, handle @mentions, perform actions, and collaborate inside your
product—just like human users. Use a simple built-in copilot powered by any LLM,
or connect your own agent framework such as n8n or LangChain.

## Key features

### Liveblocks AI Copilots

Built-in agents you can configure directly in Liveblocks.

- Works with popular LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- Add domain knowledge from text, PDFs, websites, or images (RAG)
- Fully compatible with the `<AiChat />` React component

### Agent frameworks

Bring your own multi-agent logic or external workflows.

- Return actions that update UI, add comments, respond to users, or trigger
  workflows
