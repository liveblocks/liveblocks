The default components included in Comments are a great way to start building
your application. With these components you can render entire threads, along
with a comment composer.

- Fully styled commenting components, with an optional dark mode.
- Customize through CSS variables and class names.
- Localize and modify strings with overrides.
- Can be used alongside
  [primitives](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/primitives).

## Thread

The [`Thread`][] component renders a thread and its contained comments, as well
a composer for adding new comments to thread.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/comments/thread.png"
    alt="Thread"
    width={768}
    height={446}
  />
</Figure>

### Usage

The best way to get started is to import the [`useThreads`][] hook, and loop
through each thread in the current room.

```tsx highlight="5,9-11"
import { Thread } from "@liveblocks/react-ui";
import { useThreads } from "../liveblocks.config";

function Component() {
  const { threads } = useThreads();

  return (
    <>
      {threads.map((thread) => (
        <Thread key={thread.id} thread={thread} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

This will render a list containing every thread in the room, each with its own
composer for adding new comments.

## Composer

The [`Composer`][] component renders a rich-text composer that’s used to create
new threads. It can also be used to add comments to an existing thread, or to
edit comments.

  <Image
    src="/assets/comments/composer.png"
    alt="Composer"
    width={768}
    height={446}
  />
</Figure>

### Usage

Get started by importing the component. By default, it’ll create a new thread
when the form’s submitted.

```tsx
import { Composer } from "@liveblocks/react-ui";

// Creates a new thread
function Component() {
  return <Composer />;
}
```

[`Composer`][] can also be used in other ways:

- [Adding metadata to a new thread](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Adding-thread-metadata)
- [Replying to a thread](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Replying-to-a-thread)
- [Adding metadata to a reply](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Adding-comment-metadata)
- [Modifying a comment](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Modifying-a-comment)
- [Custom behavior](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Custom-behavior)

## Comment

The [`Comment`][] component renders a single comment. It’s useful if you’re
building a custom [Thread](#Thread) component, or if you’re displaying a
standalone comment.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/comments/comment.png"
    alt="Comment"
    width={768}
    height={446}
  />
</Figure>

### Usage

Start by importing the component, and passing the comment to it.

```tsx highlight="9"
import { Comment } from "@liveblocks/react-ui";
import { ThreadData } from "@liveblocks/client";

// Renders a list of comments attached to the specified `thread`
function MyComment({ thread }: { thread: ThreadData }) {
  return (
    <>
      {thread.comments.map((comment) => (
        <Comment key={comment.id} comment={comment} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Customization

It’s possible to style and localize the default components:

- Import dark mode styles.
- Modify the style with CSS variables and class names.
- Use overrides to change default text used in the components.
