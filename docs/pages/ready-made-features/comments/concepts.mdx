A quick overview of the concepts used in Liveblocks Comments.

## Threads

In Liveblocks Comments, everything revolves around _threads_. In each
[multiplayer room](/docs/concepts/how-liveblocks-works#Rooms) you can create a
number of threads. Each individual thread contains a list of _comments_ written
by your users.

Threads can be retrieved by
[a React hook](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/hooks#threads-hook) or
[on your server](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms-roomId-threads).
Here’s an example of a thread object.

```ts
{
  type: "thread",
  id: "th_sf8s6sh...",
  roomId: "my-room-id",
  createdAt: Date <Fri Dec 15 2023 14:15:22 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)>,
  resolved: false,
  comments: [
    // A list of comments in the thread
    // ...
  ],
  metadata: {
    // Your custom thread metadata
    // ...
  },
}
```

Threads can store
[custom metadata](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/metadata), which is helpful
for integrating them into your product.

## Comments

Each comment is created by a user, referenced by their
[user ID](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/users-and-mentions), and is part of
a thread. The first comment in a thread is displayed at the top.

    alt="thread.comments[0] is the first comment in a thread"
    width={768}
    height={480}
    quality={100}
  />

Here’s an example of a single comment inside a thread object.

```ts highlight="8-24"
{
  type: "thread",
  id: "th_sf8s6sh...",
  roomId: "my-room-id",
  createdAt: Date <Fri Dec 15 2023 14:15:22 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)>,
  resolved: false,
  comments: [
    {
      type: "comment",
      threadId: "th_sf8s6sh...",
      id: "cm_agH76a...",
      roomId: "my-room-id",
      userId: "alicia@example.com",
      createdAt: Date <Fri Dec 15 2023 14:15:22 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)>,
      editedAt: Date <Fri Dec 15 2023 15:07:19 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)>,
      body: {
        // The comment's text in `CommentBody` format
        // ...
      },
      metadata: {
        // Your custom comment metadata
        // ...
      },
    },

    // Other comments in the thread
    // ...
  ],
  metadata: {
    // Your custom thread metadata
    // ...
  },
}
```

A comment’s `body` is in a custom `CommentBody` format, though you most likely
won’t need to use this, as we render it in React for you. We also provide a
number of functions that allow you to easily
[convert a comment’s body into Markdown, HTML, or plain text](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#stringify-comment-body),
which is especially helpful for creating email notifications.

Similarly to threads, comments can also store
[custom metadata](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/metadata), which is helpful
for integrating them into your product.

### Deleted comments

Deleting a comment doesn’t remove the comment object from the thread, instead
the `comment.body` property is removed, and a `comment.deletedAt` property is
added, which contains the deletion time. This allows you to handle the deleted
comment in whichever way you see fit, for example you may like to create a
“message deleted” placeholder for the comment. Alternatively, the comment can be
hidden completely.

  />

A thread is only deleted after all its comments have been deleted.
