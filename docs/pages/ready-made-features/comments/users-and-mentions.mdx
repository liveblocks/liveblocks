When a comment is posted, Liveblocks doesn’t store any user or group metadata,
for example their avatar or name. Instead, it only saves their user ID or group
ID, which you manually set when authenticating. To fetch user and group
metadata, we provide functions that allow you to return the correct data.

This page explains the concepts behind adding users and mentions to Comments. If
you’d prefer a full step-by-step tutorial, make sure to read
[how to add users to Liveblocks Comments](/docs/guides/how-to-add-users-to-liveblocks-comments).

## Authenticate your users

You can set a user’s ID when authenticating your application, for example with
[`liveblocks.prepareSession`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#access-tokens).
This ID is then used inside Comments to represent the current user, for example
we’re using an email address as a user ID below.

```ts highlight="1"
const session = liveblocks.prepareSession("charlie.layne@example.com", {
  userInfo: {
    // Custom user info to be used in Presence
    // This is NOT used in Comments
    // ...
  },
});
```

There are two different authentication methods—make sure to follow an
[authentication guide for your framework](/docs/authentication) to get started.

## Adding user information to Comments

In Comments, user information is retrieved from a list of user IDs, for example
here’s a `userIds` array and the information you need to return. You should
return the same number of users as the number of user IDs, in the same order.

```shell
# If this is `userIds`
["marc@example.com", "pierre@example.com"]

# Return `users`
[{ name: "Marc", avatar: "https://example.com/marc.png" }, { name: "Pierre", avatar: "https://example.com/pierre.png" }]
```

In your Liveblocks config file, you’ll find a function named
[`resolveUsers`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#resolveUsers) where you
can return this information.

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
// ...

const client = createClient({
  // ...
  async resolveUsers({ userIds }) {
    // ["marc@example.com", ...]
    console.log(userIds);

    // Get users from your back end
    const users = await __fetchUsers__(userIds);

    // [{ name: "Marc", avatar: "https://example.com/marc.png" }, ...]
    console.log(users);

    // Return a list of users
    return users;
  },
});
```

The `name`, and `avatar` are required for the default components, but you can
also return custom metadata here. For example, each user may have a `color`
property. You can retrieve these properties in your app with
[`useUser`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useUser).

```tsx
function Component() {
  const { user } = useUser("marc@example.com");

  // { color: "red", name: "Marc", avatar: "https://example.com/marc.png" }
  console.log(user);

  // ...
}
```

## Adding group information to Comments

Similar to users, group information is retrieved from a list of group IDs. You
should return the same number of groups as the number of group IDs, in the same
order.

```shell
# If this is `groupIds`
["engineering", "design"]

# Return `groups`
[{ name: "Engineering", avatar: "https://example.com/engineering.png" }, { name: "Design", avatar: "https://example.com/design.png" }]
```

In your Liveblocks config file, you’ll find a function named
[`resolveGroupsInfo`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#resolveGroupsInfo)
where you can return this information.

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
// ...

const client = createClient({
  // ...
  async resolveGroupsInfo({ groupIds }) {
    // ["engineering", ...]
    console.log(groupIds);

    // Get groups from your back end
    const groups = await __fetchGroups__(groupIds);

    // [{ name: "Engineering", avatar: "https://example.com/engineering.png" }, ...]
    console.log(groups);

    // Return a list of groups
    return groups;
  },
});
```

The `name` and `avatar` are required for the default components, but you can
also return custom metadata here. For example, each group may have a `color`
property. You can retrieve these properties in your app with
[`useGroupInfo`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useGroupInfo).

```tsx
function Component() {
  const { group } = useGroupInfo("engineering");

  // { color: "blue", name: "Engineering", avatar: "https://example.com/engineering.png" }
  console.log(group);

  // ...
}
```

## Resolving user and group mentions suggestions

Comments allows you to search for users and groups after typing the `"@"`
character.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/tutorials/comments/mentions.png"
    alt="Working Comments mentions"
    width={1297}
    height={781}
  />
</Figure>

When a user types `"@"` and searches for a user or group, Comments will pass you
a `text` property which you can use to return matching user IDs and group IDs.

```shell
# If "@mar" has been typed, this is `text`
"mar"

# Return matching `userIds` and `groupIds`
["marc@example.com", "marissa@example.com"]
```

You can resolve these search results by editing a function named
[`resolveMentionSuggestions`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#resolveMentionSuggestions)
in your Liveblocks config file. Here's what the function might look like if the
user has typed `"@mar"` into the input.

### User mentions only

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
// ...

const client = createClient({
  // ...
  async resolveUsers({ userIds }) {
    // ...
  },
  async resolveMentionSuggestions({ text, roomId }) {
    // "mar"
    console.log(text);

    // Return an array of user IDs for the query "mar"
    let userIds;

    if (text) {
      // If there's a query, get user IDs from your back end that match
      userIds = await __queryUserIds__(text);
    } else {
      // If there's no query, get all of the room's user IDs
      userIds = await __getAllUserIds__();
    }

    // ["marc@example.com", "marissa@example.com"]
    console.log(userIds);
    return userIds;
  },
});
```

### User and group mentions

To support both user and group mentions, you can return a list of mention
objects instead of just user IDs. This allows you to suggest a mix of users and
groups.

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
// ...

const client = createClient({
  // ...
  async resolveUsers({ userIds }) {
    // ...
  },
  async resolveGroupsInfo({ groupIds }) {
    // ...
  },
  async resolveMentionSuggestions({ text, roomId }) {
    // "mar"
    console.log(text);

    const dbUsers = await __findUsersFromDB__(roomId);
    const dbGroups = await __findGroupsFromDB__(roomId);

    // Show groups and users matching the text being typed
    return [
      ...dbGroups.map((group) => ({
        kind: "group",
        id: group.id,
      })),
      ...dbUsers.map((user) => ({
        kind: "user",
        id: user.id,
      })),
    ];
  },
});
```

If a user has only typed `"@"`, `text` is an empty string, and it's recommended
to return every user and group.
