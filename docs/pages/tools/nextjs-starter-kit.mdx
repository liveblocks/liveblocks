## Features

The Next.js Starter Kit includes the following

- Documents dashboard with pagination, drafts, groups, auto-revalidation
- Collaborative whiteboard app with a fully-featured share menu
- Authentication compatible with GitHub, Google, Auth0, and more
- Document permissions can be scoped to users, groups, and the public

## Set up the Next.js Starter Kit

### create-liveblocks-app

You can get started by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --next
```

This will run an installer that allows you to download, configure, and deploy,
your project:

<Figure>
  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source
      src="/assets/nextjs-starter-kit/create-liveblocks-app.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>

Give your project a name, and select the [authentication](#authentication)
method you’d like to use in your app. If you are trying to generate a proof of
concept quickly, opting to use demo authentication may be a great option—you can
still add other authentication providers later on.

#### Deploy with Vercel Integration

If you would like to set up CI/CD with your application, we’ve made that process
straightforward for you as well. When prompted, you can select "deploy to
Vercel" to enable building and deploying the starter kit. The Vercel Integration
will open in a new browser window for you to complete the process of adding your
repository.

<Figure>
  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source
      src="/assets/nextjs-starter-kit/deploy-on-vercel.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>

If by clicking "Create" you receive "An unexpected internal error occurred" you
should validate within your code hosting platform of choice (GitHub, GitLab,
Bitbucket) that the Vercel integration has permission to access your repository.
In GitHub, permissions can be found can be found under Settings > Integrations >
Vercel.

#### Connect to Liveblocks and retrieve your secret key

If you prefer to work locally, you can tell the installer you would not like to
"deploy to Vercel." After declining the deployment option, the installer will
prompt adding your Liveblocks Key to the application automatically. If you
forwent deployment or indicated that you would like to get your Liveblocks
secret key automatically, the Liveblocks integration page will open in a new
browser tab. Once the integration page appears, you can sign up/sign in to
Liveblocks, create a new project, and import your API key into the installer.

      src="/assets/nextjs-starter-kit/create-liveblocks-project.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>

After finishing up, check the installer and follow the commands recommended to
get you started.

### Authentication [#authentication]

The Liveblocks starter kit uses [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for
authentication, meaning many authentication providers can be configured with
minimal code changes. A demo authentication system is used by default, but it’s
easy to add real providers, such as GitHub, Auth0, and more.

Take a look at the guide for your chosen authentication method:

- [GitHub authentication](#github-authentication)
- [Auth0 authentication](#auth0-authentication)
- [Demo authentication](#demo-authentication)

### GitHub authentication [#github-authentication]

To use GitHub auth, make sure you selected "GitHub authentication" when running
the installer (or you’ve set up the
[provider manually](#add-multiple-authentication-providers)). This is how to set
up your GitHub secret key and client id.

1. Go to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps) on GitHub and
   click "New GitHub App".
2. Enter an app name (e.g. `Liveblocks Starter Kit (dev)`). You’ll need a new
   app for each environment, so it’s helpful to place "dev" in the name.
3. Add a homepage URL—this isn’t important now, so a placeholder will do.
4. Find the "Callback URL" input just below, and add your local development URL
   (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).
5. Look for the "Webhook" section and make sure to uncheck "Active".
6. Use the remaining default settings and press "Create GitHub App".

<Figure>
  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source src="/assets/nextjs-starter-kit/github-auth.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

7. On the next page under "Client secrets", press the "Generate a new client
   secret" button (note that this is different to generating a private key!).
8. Copy this secret into the `/.env.local` file as `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
9. Go back to the previous page and find the "Client ID" near the top. Copy this
   into your `.env.local` file as `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`

Almost there! `.env.local` should now contain lines similar to this:

```dotenv file=".env.local"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

GitHub authentication is now complete! Next,
[add yourself as a user](#how-to-sign-up) to test out your authentication.

### Auth0 authentication [#auth0-authentication]

To use Auth0 auth, make sure you selected "Auth0 authentication" when running
the installer (or you’ve set up the
[provider manually](#add-multiple-authentication-providers)). This is how to set
up your Auth0 secret key and client information.

1. Go to your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard) and click
   "Create Application".
2. Enter an app name (e.g. `Liveblocks Starter Kit (dev)`). You’ll need a new
   app for each environment, so it’s helpful to place "dev" in the name.
3. Select "Single Page Web Applications", and press "Create".
4. Copy your "Client ID" from the top of the page, and place it within
   `.env.local` as `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`.
5. Click the "Settings" tab— we’ll be making a number of changes here.
6. Find the "Client Secret" input field, and copy the value into `.env.local` as
   `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`.
7. Copy your "Domain" from the input field, add "https://" to the start, and
   place it within `.env.local` as `AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL`.
8. Add the following to the "Allowed Callback URLs" textarea:
   `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/auth0`.
9. Add the following to the "Allowed Logout URLs" textarea:
   `http://localhost:3000`.
10. Scroll to the bottom and press "Save changes".

<Figure>
  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source src="/assets/nextjs-starter-kit/auth0-auth.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

`.env.local` should now contain these three lines, along with anything
previously there:

```dotenv file=".env.local"
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.com
```

Auth0 authentication is now set up! Next, [add yourself a user](#how-to-sign-up)
to test out your authentication.

### Demo authentication [#demo-authentication]

For quickly testing out your app, the demo authentication method can be used.
This method uses a NextAuth
[`CredentialsProvider`](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/credentials) to
simulate a real sign in system. To replace it with your own authentication
method, you can add any other NextAuth
[`Provider`](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/) to
[`/auth.config.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/auth.config.ts).

Read the [next section](#how-to-sign-up) to learn how to add a new user to your
demo application.

### How to sign up - add yourself as a user [#how-to-sign-up]

We haven’t set up a database, so we’re temporarily using the
[`/data`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/data)
folder instead. Before any user can sign in, they need to be added to
[`/data/users.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/data/users.ts).
Navigate there and add your details, for example, if you’re signing in with
`yourname@example.com`:

```ts file="data/users.ts"
{
  id: "yourname@example.com",
  name: "Your Name",
  avatar: "https://liveblocks.io/avatars/avatar-0.png",
  groupIds: ["product", "engineering", "design"],
},
```

Note that this is replacing the sign-up process, so you must enter the email of
any new user. If, for example, you’re using GitHub authentication, you can enter
the email address of any valid GitHub account.

### Ready to go

The Next.js Starter Kit is now ready to use! After setting up authentication,
make sure to restart the dev server to see your authentication in action.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Assorted info

### Structure

The
[starter kit](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit)
has the following structure:

```
app
components
data
icons
layouts
lib
 └─ actions
 └─ database
 └─ hooks
 └─ utils
primitives
styles
types
auth.ts
auth.config.ts
liveblocks.config.ts
liveblocks.server.config.ts
package.json
```

The important thing to note is that there are primitives, which are base level
components such as buttons (think of these as the small building blocks of a
page), components, which you can think of as multiplayer implementations
(cursors, badges, etc), app, which renders document level experiences and a
library (lib) of both server side and client side methods which contain the
logic to create and modify documents.

### Async fetching and error handling

This starter kit makes extensive use of the following programming pattern for
fetching async resources:

```ts
const { data, error } = await getDocument({
  /* ... */
});

// An error has occured
if (error) {
  // { code: 400, message: "Document not found", suggestion: "Please check the URL is..." }
  console.log(error);
  return;
}

// Success, but result is empty
if (!data) {
  return;
}

// Success
// { name: "my-document", id: "hIas7GuihgHF8Fhv8Sskg",  ... }
console.log(data);
```

### Document functions

Much of the starter kit’s power is in the
[`/lib/actions`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/lib/actions)
directory. The functions in these files allow you to edit your documents easily
and return type-safe objects. For example in an API endpoint:

```ts
import { createDocument } from "@/lib/actions";

export async function POST() {
  // Create a new document
  const { data, error } = await createDocument({
    name: "My document",
    type: "whiteboard",
    userId: "charlie.layne@example.com",
  });

  // ...
}
```

Because these functions are server actions, they can be leveraged on both client
and server.

```tsx
import { createDocument } from "@/lib/actions";

export function CreateDocumentButton() {
  async function handleCreateDocument() {
    // Create a new document
    const { data, error } = await createDocument({
      name: "My document",
      type: "whiteboard",
      userId: "charlie.layne@example.com",
    });
  }

  return <button onClick={handleCreateDocument}>New document</button>;
}
```

Functions that return data can be used with [SWR hooks](https://swr.vercel.app/)
that automatically update your data in components. For example,
`getDocumentUsers` returns a list of users with access to the room:

```tsx
// Convert from this
const { data, error } = await getDocumentUsers({
  documentId: "my-document-id",
});

// To this
const { data, error } = useDocumentsFunctionSWR([
  getDocumentUsers,
  {
    documentId: "my-document-id",
  },
]);
```

Here’s a working example:

```tsx
import { getDocumentUsers, useDocumentsFunctionSWR } from "../../lib/client";

export function ListUsers() {
  // Get users attached to a document and update every 1000ms
  const { data: users, error: usersError } = useDocumentsFunctionSWR(
    [
      getDocumentUsers,
      {
        documentId: "my-document-id",
      },
    ],
    { refreshInterval: 1000 }
  );

  if (usersError) {
    return <div>Error</div>;
  }

  if (!users) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li>user.name</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

### How to extend the Document type

If you’d like to add a new property to `Document`, it’s simple. First, edit the
`Document` type in
[`/types/documents.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/types/document.ts):

```ts file="types/documents.ts"
export type Document = {
  // Your new property
  randomNumber: number;
  //...
};
```

Then modify the return value in
[`/lib/utils/buildDocuments.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/lib/utils/buildDocuments.ts).
This is a function that converts a Liveblocks room into your custom document
format:

```ts file="lib/utils/buildDocuments.ts"
// Return our custom Document format
const document: Document = {
  randomNumber: Math.random(),
  // ...
};
```

Next, run the following command to check for problems:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

If no errors are returned, the document properties were successfully extended.

### How to extend the User & Session type

Similar to the way we extend the `Document` type, we can also extend the `User`
and `Session` type.

Adding a new property to `User`/`Session` is simple. First, edit the `User` type
in
[`/types/data.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/types/data.ts).

```ts file="types/data.ts"
export type User = {
  // Your new property
  randomNumber: number;
  // ...
};
```

Then make sure to return this new property in
[`/lib/database/getUser.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/lib/database/getUser.ts).

```ts file="lib/database/getUser.ts"
return { randomNumber: Math.random() /* ... */ };
```

The new property will now be available to use in your app:

```ts
// randomNumber: Math.random(),
console.log(session.user.info.randomNumber);
```

#### Adding this to your Liveblocks app (optional)

Liveblocks presence is a way of displaying online presence between users,
helpful for live avatars, realtime cursors, etc., and it’s possible to attach a
properties to it for each user. To make a property accessible in presence (and
within the React hooks used in whiteboard), you must modify `UserInfo` in
[`/liveblocks.config.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/liveblocks.config.ts).

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
export type UserInfo = Pick<User, "randomNumber" /* ... */>;
```

In this example
[Pick](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html) creates
the UserInfo type based off of the User type and adds additional keys based on
the properties you provide. After this, modify
[`/lib/actions/authorizeLiveblocks.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/lib/actions/authorizeLiveblocks.ts).
First, we’ll give an anonymous user a property:

```ts file="lib/actions/authorizeLiveblocks.ts"
// Anonymous user info
const anonymousUser: User = {
  randomNumber: Math.random(),
  // ...
};
```

Next, we’ll get the signed-in user’s property:

```ts file="lib/actions/authorizeLiveblocks.ts"
// Get current user info from session (defined in /auth.config.ts)
// If no session found, this is a logged out/anonymous user
const {
  randomNumber,
  // ...
} = session?.user.info ?? anonymousUser;
```

And then pass this info to `authorize`:

```ts file="lib/actions/authorizeLiveblocks.ts"
// Get Liveblocks access token
const { data, error } = await authorize({
  userInfo: { randomNumber /* ... */ },
  // ...
});
```

To make sure to check everything’s hooked up correctly:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Once that’s working, the new property can then be used in your app:

```tsx
// My random number
const myRandomNumber = useSelf((me) => me.info.randomNumber);

// An array of everyone else’s random numbers
const everyonesRandomNumbers = useOthersMapped(
  (other) => other.info.randomNumber
);
```

### Adding multiple authentication providers [#add-multiple-authentication-providers]

It’s possible to add multiple authentication providers to the starter kit using
[NextAuth Providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/). Open
[`/auth.config.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/auth.config.ts)
and place your providers in the object:

```ts
import GithubProvider from "next-auth/providers/github";
import Auth0Provider from "next-auth/providers/auth0";

export const authOptions = {
  // ...
  providers: {
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
    }),
    Auth0Provider({
      clientId: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID as string,
      clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
      issuer: process.env.AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL as string,
    }),
  }
};
```

It’s not only possible with GitHub and Auth0, any
[NextAuth provider](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/) will work, such as
Google, X, Reddit, or more. You can find more information about getting the
necessary secrets on the NextAuth documentation, or on the provider’s website.

Note that if you’re using `CredentialsProvider` (for example, as used in the
demo authentication), `CredentialsProvider` must be removed before any other
authentication methods will appear.

### Switching themes

The starter kit comes with both a dark mode and light mode. By default, the user
sees the theme that corresponds to their system setting, but it’s easy to switch
your whole app to just dark or light mode by modifying
[`styles/globals.css`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/styles/globals.css).

- To use only light mode, remove the entire
  `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` media query.
- To use only dark mode, copy the "Dark mode" CSS variables into the "Light
  mode" section, then remove the entire `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
  media query.

### Adding a database

To add a database you need to modify the following async functions to return the
correct properties:

- [`/lib/database/getGroup.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/lib/database/getGroup.ts)
- [`/lib/database/getGroups.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/lib/database/getGroups.ts)
- [`/lib/database/getUser.ts`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/main/starter-kits/nextjs-starter-kit/lib/database/getUser.ts)

You can then remove the `/data` folder. Everything else should work as expected.
