## Features

Our MCP server features 39 different tools, enabling most features from our
[REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints). You can use it to:

- Create and modify rooms, threads, comments, notifications, more.
- Read realtime Storage and Yjs values.
- Broadcast custom events to connected clients.
- Mark threads and notifications as read/unread.

AI will often string tool calls together—for example, if you ask it to fetch a
room that doesn’t exist, it will ask if you’d like to create the room first, and
then fetch it after.

## Automatic setup

To install automatically, use one of the following commands, making sure to
insert a secret key from your correct project in [your dashboard](/dashboard).

<Banner type="warning" title="Only for development">

Don’t insert a secret key from your product application, as AI will have direct
access to modify it.
