Our [DevTools](/devtools) is a browser-based extension that integrates with
Liveblocks and your local development environment. This allows you to easily
inspect, visualize, and troubleshoot your collaborative online experiences.

Our DevTools is currently only available if you are on Liveblocks 1.0 or later.
To view step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade your project to Liveblocks
1.0, check out our [upgrade guides](/docs/platform/upgrading/).

## Install the browser extension

Our DevTools extension is available for all major web browsers:

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/liveblocks-devtools/iiagocfmmhknpdalddkbiejnfmbmlffk)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/liveblocks-devtools/)
- [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/liveblocks-devtools/hfecmmnilleegmjaegkjjklnjbgadikg)

Within the “Liveblocks” panel, you will see two panes: storage and presence. The
storage pane represents each object that you have defined in storage as a tree,
likewise, the presence pane represents each user that is connected to your
Liveblocks project.

## Trying our DevTools

### With our Starter Kit

The [Liveblocks Starter Kit](/starter-kit) is a great way to get started with
Liveblocks and learn how to use our DevTools.

    <source
      src="/assets/devtools/liveblocks-devtools-starter-kit.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>
To use the Starter Kit with DevTools, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --next
```

You can then follow the guided prompts in the terminal to create your project.
For additional information on how to use the Starter Kit, see the
[Starter Kit guide](/docs/tools/nextjs-starter-kit).

Once you have completed the Starter Kit prompts and installed the extension, run
the Starter Kit with `npm run dev` and open your browser to `localhost:3000`.
You should authenticate, and then create a new draft document. Once you have
created a new document, open up the developer tools window. Find the newly
available “Liveblocks” panel there.

### With an example from our gallery

All of [our examples](/examples) hosted on Liveblocks.io are available for you
to run locally from the
[examples directory](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/examples)
in the Liveblocks repo. For testing and reviewing how to use our DevTools, we
will use the
[Advanced Collaborative Spreadsheet](https://liveblocks.io/examples/collaborative-spreadsheet-advanced/nextjs).

To download this example, run the following command, and follow the guided
prompts to create your project:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --example nextjs-spreadsheet-advanced
```

Once you have completed the prompts and installed the extension, run the example
with `npm run dev` and open your browser to `localhost:3000`.

Open your browser and open up the developer tools window. Find the newly
available “Liveblocks” panel there, and you should see the values from the
spreadsheet examples populating storage.

## Features and tips

### Highlighting

When a value in storage changes, the DevTools will highlight the value to
indicate that it has changed.

### Search

Storage values are searchable by key and regex.

### Hover

Hovering over a value in storage or presence makes an eye icon appear. If
clicked, it displays the value of that key.

### Expand and collapse

- You can expand and collapse objects with one level of depth by using the arrow
  keys or spacebar
- You can quickly expand and collapse nested objects within storage by holding
  the alt/option key and clicking on the object

<Banner title="Initialization">

If you open the DevTools after a Liveblocks client has already been initialized,
you may see an empty page. This is because our DevTools is only able to retrieve
the current state of storage and presence. To fix this, you can refresh the page
or open the DevTools before initializing the Liveblocks client.
