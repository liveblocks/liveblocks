In this guide, you’ll learn how to use integrate Liveblocks into your React +
Zustand application. The `@liveblocks/zustand` package provides a middleware to
turn selected parts of your Zustand store into a real‑time shared state between
clients. This approach makes it easy to convert an existing non-collaborative
application into one. It also enables you to keep your front-end architecture
without sprinkling Liveblocks code all over your code base.

If you’re not using a state-management library, we recommend reading our
dedicated React guide below:

- [React guide][]

You can also
[follow our step-by-step tutorial](/docs/tutorials/collaborative-to-do-list/react-zustand)
to learn how to use Liveblocks.

## Install Liveblocks into your project [#install-liveblocks]

First, create a new app with
[`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/):

```bash
npx create-react-app my-zustand-app --template typescript
```

To start a plain JavaScript project, you can omit the `--template typescript`
flag.

Then install the Liveblocks packages and Zustand:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/zustand zustand
```

## Connect to Liveblocks

You’ll need an API key in order to use Liveblocks.
[Create a Liveblocks account](/api/auth/signup) to get
[your API key](/dashboard/apikeys). It should start with `pk_`.

Then, create a client with [`createClient`][] and set your public key as shown
below.

```ts file="src/store.ts"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});
```

## Setup your Liveblocks real‑time middleware [#setup-middleware]

Use the `liveblocks` real‑time middleware with your store and pass the client
created previously as the configuration. This will add a new `liveblocks`
property to your store’s state, enabling you to interact with our Presence and
Storage APIs.

```ts file="src/store.ts"
import create from "zustand";
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
import type { WithLiveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";

type State = {
  // Your Zustand state type will be defined here
};

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});

const useStore = create<WithLiveblocks<State>>()(
  liveblocks(
    (set) => ({
      // Your state and actions will go here
    }),
    { client }
  )
);

export default useStore;
```

## Connect to a Liveblocks room [#connect-to-room]

A room is the virtual space where people collaborate. To create a multiplayer
experience, you’ll need to connect your users to a Liveblocks room.

Use `liveblocks.enterRoom` to start syncing parts of your store to the
Liveblocks room and use `liveblocks.leaveRoom` to stop the synchronization. With
React `useEffect`, you can automatically enter and leave a Liveblocks room as
your component is mounting and unmounting.

```tsx file="src/App.tsx"
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import useStore from "./store";

import "./App.css";

const App = () => {
  const {
    liveblocks: { enterRoom, leaveRoom },
  } = useStore();

  useEffect(() => {
    enterRoom("room-id");
    return () => {
      leaveRoom("room-id");
    };
  }, [enterRoom, leaveRoom]);

  return <div>Your App</div>;
};

export default App;
```

## Get other users in the room [#get-others]

If you want to list all the people connected to the room, you can use
`liveblocks.others` to get an array of the other users in the room.

```tsx
import useStore from "./store";

function YourComponent() {
  useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.others);
}
```

## Update user presence [#update-presence]

To create immersive multiplayer experiences, it’s helpful for each person in the
room to share their real‑time state with other connected users. That real‑time
state often corresponds to a cursor position or even the item a user has
currently selected. We call this concept “Presence”.

For instance, to share the cursor’s position in real‑time with others, we’re
going to add a new `presenceMapping` option to our `liveblocks` middleware
configuration to specify which part of the state maps to the current user’s
presence. In this case, we’re updating the `cursor` position in our store in the
`onPointerMove` event listener in our React component.

```ts file="src/store.ts" highlight="6,9-10,20-21,25-27"
import create from "zustand";
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
import type { WithLiveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";

type Cursor = { x: number; y: number };

type State = {
  cursor: Cursor;
  setCursor: (cursor: Cursor) => void;
};

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});

const useStore = create<WithLiveblocks<State>>()(
  liveblocks(
    (set) => ({
      cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      setCursor: (cursor) => set({ cursor }),
    }),
    {
      client,
      presenceMapping: {
        cursor: true,
      },
    }
  )
);

export default useStore;
```

```tsx file="src/App.tsx" highlight="18-24"
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import useStore from "./store";

import "./App.css";

const App = () => {
  const {
    liveblocks: { enterRoom, leaveRoom },
  } = useStore();

  useEffect(() => {
    enterRoom("room-id");
    return () => {
      leaveRoom("room-id");
    };
  }, [enterRoom, leaveRoom]);

  const setCursor = useStore((state) => state.setCursor);
  return (
    <div
      style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}
      onPointerMove={(e) => setCursor({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY })}
    />
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Get other users’ presence [#get-others-presence]

Get people’s cursor positions with
`liveblocks.others.map(user => user.presence.cursor)`.

```tsx file="src/App.tsx"
function App() {
  /* ... */

  const others = useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.others);
  const othersCursors = others.map((user) => user.presence.cursor);

  // Render cursors with custom SVGs based on x and y
}
```

## Sync and persist the state across client [#storage-intro]

As opposed to the “presence”, some collaborative features require that every
user interacts with the same piece of state. For example, in Google Docs, it is
the paragraphs, headings, images in the document. In Figma, it’s all the shapes
that make your design. That’s what we call the room’s “storage”.

The room’s storage is a conflicts-free state that multiple users can edit at the
same time. It is persisted to our backend even after everyone leaves the room.
Liveblocks provides custom data structures inspired by
[CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) that
can be nested to create the state that you want.

- [`LiveObject`][] - Similar to JavaScript object. If multiple users update the
  same property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
  servers is the winner.
- [`LiveList`][] - An ordered collection of items synchronized across clients.
  Even if multiple users add/remove/move elements simultaneously, LiveList will
  solve the conflicts to ensure everyone sees the same collection of items.
- [`LiveMap`][] - Similar to a JavaScript Map. If multiple users update the same
  property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
  servers is the winner.

When using our Zustand integration you don't need to interact directly with
these data structures. Our middleware synchronize your store with our data
structures based on the `storageMapping` configuration.

Here is an example to explain how it works under the hood. Imagine you have the
following store:

```ts file="src/store.ts" highlight="6-8,20-22"
/* ...client setup */

const useStore = create<WithLiveblocks<State>>()(
  liveblocks(
    (set) => ({
      firstName: "Marie",
      lastName: "Curie",
      discoveries: ["Polonium", "Radium"],

      setFirstName: (firstName) => set({ firstName }),
      setLastName: (lastName) => set({ lastName }),
      addDiscovery: (discovery) =>
        set((state) => ({
          discoveries: state.discoveries.concat([discovery]),
        })),
    }),
    {
      client,
      storageMapping: {
        firstName: true,
        lastName: true,
        discoveries: true,
      },
    }
  )
);
```

With this setup, the room's `storage` root is:

```ts
const root = new LiveObject({
  firstName: "Marie",
  lastName: "Curie",
  discoveries: new LiveList(["Polonium", "Radium"]),
});
```

If you update your store by calling `setFirstName("Pierre")`, the middleware
will do `root.set("firstName", "Pierre")` for you and update the store of all
the users currently connected to the room. The middleware compares the previous
state and the new state to detect changes and patch our data structures
accordingly.

The reverse process happens when receiving updates from other clients; the
middleware patches your immutable state.

When entering a room with `liveblocks.enterRoom`, the middleware fetches the
room's storage from our server and patches your store. If this is the first time
you're entering a room, the storage will be initialized with the current value
in your Zustand state, typically your initial state.

## Multiplayer undo/redo [#undo-redo]

Implementing undo/redo when multiple users can edit the app state simultaneously
is quite complex!

**When only one user can edit the app state, undo/redo acts like a "time
machine"**; undo/redo replaces the current app state with an app state that was
already be seen by the user.

When multiple users are involved, undo or redo can lead to an app state that no
one has seen before. For example, let's imagine a design tool with two users
editing the same circle.

- Initial state => `{ radius: "10px", color: "yellow" }`
- User A sets the `color` to `blue` => `{ radius: "10px", color: "blue" }`
- User B sets the `radius` to `20px` => `{ radius: "20px", color: "blue" }`
- User A realizes that it prefered the circle in yellow and undoes **its last
  modification** => `{ radius: "20px", color: "yellow" }`

A yellow circle with a radius of 20px in a completely new state. **Undo/redo in
a multiplayer app does not act like a "time machine"; it only undoes local
operation**.

The good news is that [`room.history.undo`][] and [`room.history.redo`][] takes
that complexity out of your hands so you can focus on the core features of your
app.

Access these two functions from your store like below so you can easily bind
them to keyboard events (⌘+Z/⌘+⇧+Z on Mac and Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y on Windows) or undo
and redo buttons in your application..

```tsx
import useStore from "../store";

function YourComponent() {
  const undo = useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.room?.history.undo);
  const redo = useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.room?.history.redo);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={undo}>Undo</button>
      <button onClick={redo}>Redo</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Pause and resume history [#pause-resume]

Some applications require skipping intermediate states from the undo/redo
history. Let's consider a design tool; when a user drags a rectangle, the
intermediate rectangle positions should not be part of the undo/redo history.
But they should be shared with the rest of the room to create a great
experience.

[`room.history.pause`][] and [`room.history.resume`][] lets you skip these
intermediate states. To go back to our design tool example, the sequence of
calls would look like that:

- User presses the rectangle
- Call `room.history.pause` to skip future operations from the history
- User drags the rectangle
- User release the rectangle
- Call `room.history.resume`

At this point, if the user calls `room.history.undo`, the rectangle will go back
to its initial position.

```tsx
import useStore from "../store";

const pause = useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.room?.history.pause);
const resume = useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.room?.history.resume);
```
