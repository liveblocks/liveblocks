Liveblocks is a realtime collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start making your Redux
state multiplayer by using the
[store enhancer](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/glossary#store-enhancer)
from the [`@liveblocks/redux`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-redux) package.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install Liveblocks</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Every package should use the same version.

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/redux
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Initialize the `liveblocks.config.ts` file</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      We can use this file later to [define types for our application](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#Typing-your-data).

      ```bash
      npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --init --framework react
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Connect your Redux store to Liveblocks</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Create the Liveblocks client and use the
      `liveblocksEnhancer` in your Redux store setup. This will
      add a new state called `liveblocks` to your store, enabling
      you to interact with our Presence and Storage APIs.

      ```ts file="store.ts" highlight="7-9,24-25"
      "use client";

      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
      import { liveblocksEnhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";
      import { configureStore, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

      const client = createClient({
        publicApiKey: "pk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      });

      const initialState = {};

      const slice = createSlice({
        name: "state",
        initialState,
        reducers: {
          /* logic will be added here */
        },
      });

      function makeStore() {
        return configureStore({
          reducer: slice.reducer,
          enhancers: (getDefaultEnhancers) =>
            getDefaultEnhancers().concat(liveblocksEnhancer({ client })),
        });
      }

      const store = makeStore();

      export default store;
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Join a Liveblocks room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people collaborate.
      To create a realtime experience, multiple users must be connected to the same room.

      ```tsx file="App.tsx" highlight="5,11,14"
      "use client";

      import { useEffect } from "react";
      import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
      import { actions } from "@liveblocks/redux";

      export default function App() {
        const dispatch = useDispatch();

        useEffect(() => {
          dispatch(actions.enterRoom("room-id"));

          return () => {
            dispatch(actions.leaveRoom("room-id"));
          };
        }, [dispatch]);

        return <Room />;
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Use the Liveblocks data from the store</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks data from the Redux store.

      ```tsx file="Room.tsx" highlight="6"
      "use client";

      import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

      export function Room() {
        const others = useSelector((state) => state.liveblocks.others);
        const userCount = others.length;
        return <div>There are {userCount} other user(s) online</div>;
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Next: set up authentication</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication endpoint
      where everyone automatically has access to rooms. This approach is great for
      prototyping and marketing pages where setting up your own security isn’t always
      required. If you want to limit access to a room for certain users, you’ll need
      to set up an authentication endpoint to enable permissions.

      <Button asChild className="not-markdown">
        <a href="/docs/authentication">
          Set up authentication
        </a>
      </Button>
    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>
