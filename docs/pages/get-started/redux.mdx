Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start making your Redux
state multiplayer by using the
[store enhancer](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/glossary#store-enhancer)
from the [`@liveblocks/redux`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-redux) package.

## Quickstart

    {
      title: "Install Liveblocks",

          Create the Liveblocks client and use the <code>enhancer</code> in your
          Redux store setup. This will add a new state called{" "}
          <code>liveblocks</code> to your store, enabling you to interact with
          our Presence and Storage APIs.

      description: (
        <>
          By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication
          endpoint. This approach is great for prototyping and marketing pages
          where defining your own security isn’t always required. If you want to
          implement your own security logic to define if certain users should
          have access to a given room, you’ll need to implement an
          authentication endpoint.
