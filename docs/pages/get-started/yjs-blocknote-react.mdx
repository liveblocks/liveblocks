Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding
collaboration to your React application using the APIs from the
[`@liveblocks/yjs`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-yjs) package.

Yjs support is currently in beta. If you have any questions or feedback, please

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install Liveblocks, Yjs, and BlockNote</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react @liveblocks/yjs yjs @blocknote/core @blocknote/react
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Initialize the `liveblocks.config.ts` file</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --init --framework react
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the Liveblocks client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which
      will be responsible for communicating with the back end. You can do
      this by modifying `createClient` in your config file, and
      passing your public API key.

      ```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
      const client = createClient({
        publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Join a Liveblocks room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people
      collaborate. To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be
      connected to the same room.

      ```tsx file="index.tsx" highlight="7-11"
      import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";
      import { Editor } from "./Editor";
      import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";

      export default function Page() {
        return (
          <RoomProvider id="my-room" initialPresence={{}}>
            <ClientSideSuspense fallback="Loading…">
              {() => <Editor />}
            </ClientSideSuspense>
          </RoomProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the collaborative BlockNote text editor</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Now that we set up Liveblocks, we can start integrating BlockNote and Yjs in the `Editor.tsx` file.

      ```tsx file="Editor.tsx"
      import { BlockNoteEditor } from "@blocknote/core";
      import { BlockNoteView, useBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
      import * as Y from "yjs";
      import LiveblocksProvider from "@liveblocks/yjs";

      type EditorProps = {
        doc: Y.Doc,
        provider: any;
      }

      function Editor() {
        const room = useRoom();
        const [doc, setDoc] = useState<Y.Doc>();
        const [provider, setProvider] = useState<any>();

        // Set up Liveblocks Yjs provider
        useEffect(() => {
          const yDoc = new Y.Doc();
          const yProvider = new LiveblocksProvider(room, yDoc);
          setDoc(yDoc);
          setProvider(yProvider);

          return () => {
            yDoc?.destroy();
            yProvider?.destroy();
          };
        }, [room]);

        if (!doc || !provider) {
          return null;
        }

        return <BlockNoteEditor doc={doc} provider={provider} />;
      }


      function BlockNoteEditor({ doc, provider }: EditorProps) {
        const editor: BlockNoteEditor = useBlockNote({
          collaboration: {
            provider,

            // Where to store BlockNote data in the Y.Doc:
            fragment: doc.getXmlFragment("document-store"),

            // Information for this user:
            user: {
              name: "My Username",
              color: "#ff0000",
            },
          },
        });

        return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Next: set up authentication</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication endpoint
      where everyone automatically has access to rooms. This approach is great for
      prototyping and marketing pages where setting up your own security isn’t always
      required. If you want to limit access to a room for certain users, you’ll need
      to set up an authentication endpoint to enable permissions.
