Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding
collaboration to your Vue.js application using the APIs from the
[`@liveblocks/client`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client) package.

Liveblocks does not have a package for Vue.js. If you would like to have one, or
even better if you have ideas about what kind of API you would like to use,
please let us know about it on this
[Github issue](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/issues/1).
