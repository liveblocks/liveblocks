In this guide, you’ll learn how to use integrate Liveblocks with Vue.js. The
`@liveblocks/client` package provides the Liveblocks Presence and Storage APIs
you’ll be integrating with.

This guide assumes that you’re already familiar with
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

## Install Liveblocks into your project [#install]

### Install the Liveblocks client package [#setup]

Run the following command to install the Liveblocks client package:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client
```

[`@liveblocks/client`][] lets you connect to Liveblocks servers.

Liveblocks does not have a package for Vue.js as we have for React. If you would
like to have one, or even better if you have ideas about what kind of API you
would like to use, please let us know about it on this
[Github issue](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/issues/1).

### Connect to Liveblocks [#connect-to-liveblocks]

To connect to Liveblocks, you need to create a Liveblocks client with
[`createClient`][] inside one of your Vue component.

```js
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

// Create a Liveblocks client
// Replace this key with your secret key provided at
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});
```

Liveblocks should now be installed into your project!

## Connect to a Liveblocks room [#connect-room]

A room is the virtual space where people collaborate. To create a multiplayer
experience, you’ll need to connect your users to a Liveblocks room following the
instructions below.

### Using Client.enter to connect to a room [#client-enter]

You can easily connect to a room by using [`client.enter`][] as shown below.

```js
const room = client.enter("your-room-id", { initialPresence: {} });
```

### Using Liveblocks Client methods [#client-methods]

Now that we have our room setup, we can start using Liveblocks Client methods to
share any kind of data between users. For instance, [`Room.subscribe.others`][]
allows us to subscribe to the other users updates.

#### With the Vue Options API

```html
<template>
  <span>{{message}}</span>
</template>

<script>
  import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

  // Create a Liveblocks client
  // Replace this key with your secret key provided at
  // https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
  const client = createClient({
    publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
  });

  const roomId = "my-room";

  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        message: "You’re the only one here.",
      };
    },
    mounted() {
      const room = client.enter(roomId, { initialPresence: {} });
      this._unsubscribeOthers = room.subscribe("others", this.onOthersChange);
    },
    unmounted() {
      this._unsubscribeOthers();
      client.leave(roomId);
    },
    methods: {
      onOthersChange(others) {
        if (others.count === 0) {
          this.message = "You’re the only one here.";
        } else if (others.count === 1) {
          this.message = "There is one other person here.";
        } else {
          this.message = "There are " + others.count + " other people here.";
        }
      },
    },
  };
</script>
```

#### With the Vue Composition API

```html
<script setup>
  import { onUnmounted, ref } from "vue";
  import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

  // Create a Liveblocks client
  // Replace this key with your secret key provided at
  // https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
  const client = createClient({
    publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
  });

  const roomId = "my-room";
  const room = client.enter(roomId, { initialPresence: {} });

  const message = ref("You’re the only one here.");

  function onOthersChange(others) {
    if (others.count === 0) {
      message.value = "You’re the only one here.";
    } else if (others.count === 1) {
      message.value = "There is one other person here.";
    } else {
      message.value = "There are " + others.count + " other people here.";
    }
  }

  const unsubscribeOthers = room.subscribe("others", onOthersChange);

  onUnmounted(() => {
    unsubscribeOthers();
    client.leave(roomId);
  });
</script>

<template>
  <span>{{message}}</span>
</template>
```

## Bonus: setup authentication endpoint [#authentication]

Using the public key allows you to use Liveblocks without implementing your own
authentication endpoint. It’s great for prototyping and marketing websites.

If you want to implement your own security and define if the current user has
access to a specific room, you can follow the [Authentication guide][].

If you are using Nuxt.js, you can also check the [Nuxt.js Authentication
guide][].
