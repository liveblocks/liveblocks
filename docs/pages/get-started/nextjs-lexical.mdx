Liveblocks is a realtime collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding
collaboration to your Next.js application using the APIs from the
[`@liveblocks/react-lexical`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-lexicals)
package.

<Banner title="Next.js 14" type="warning">

Our Lexical plugin is currently in beta and is not compatible with Next.js
versions 14.2.0 and above. We recommend using Next.js 14.1 or disabling strict
mode until a new version of Lexical is released. For more details and to follow
the progress, please refer to the GitHub PR
[here](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/pull/6271).

Lexical support is currently in beta. If you have any questions or feedback,
please join us on our [Discord server](https://liveblocks.io/discord). We’d love
to hear from you.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install Liveblocks and Lexical</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Every Liveblocks package should use the same version.

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react @liveblocks/react-ui @liveblocks/react-lexical lexical @lexical/react
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Initialize the `liveblocks.config.ts` file</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      We can use this file later to [define types for our application](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#Typing-your-data).

      ```bash
      npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --init --framework react
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Create a Liveblocks room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people
      collaborate, and to create a realtime experience, multiple users must
      be connected to the same room. When using Next.js’ `/app` router,
      we recommend creating your room in a `Room.tsx` file in the same directory
      as your current route.

      Set up a Liveblocks client with
      [`LiveblocksProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProvider),
      join a room with [`RoomProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RoomProvider),
      and use [`ClientSideSuspense`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#ClientSideSuspense)
      to add a loading spinner to your app.

      ```tsx file="app/Room.tsx" highlight="12-18"
      "use client";

      import { ReactNode } from "react";
      import {
        LiveblocksProvider,
        RoomProvider,
        ClientSideSuspense,
      } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";

      export function Room({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
        return (
          <LiveblocksProvider publicApiKey={"{{PUBLIC_KEY}}"}>
            <RoomProvider id="my-room">
              <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
                {children}
              </ClientSideSuspense>
            </RoomProvider>
          </LiveblocksProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Add the Liveblocks room to your page</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      After creating your room file, it’s time to join it. Import
      your room into your `page.tsx` file, and place
      your collaborative app components inside it.

      ```tsx file="app/page.tsx" highlight="6-8"
      import { Room } from "./Room";
      import { Editor } from "./Editor";

      export default function Page() {
        return (
          <Room>
            <Editor/>
          </Room>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the collaborative Lexical text editor</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Now that we set up Liveblocks, we can start integrating Lexical and Liveblocks in the `Editor.tsx` file.
      To make the editor collaborative, we can use
      [`LiveblocksPlugin`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-lexical#LiveblocksPlugin)
      from `@liveblocks/lexical-react`. [`FloatingComposer`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-lexical#FloatingComposer)
      is optional and adds [Comments](/docs/products/comments) to your text editor.


      ```tsx file="Editor.tsx"
      "use client";

      import { LexicalComposer } from "@lexical/react/LexicalComposer";
      import { RichTextPlugin } from "@lexical/react/LexicalRichTextPlugin";
      import { ContentEditable } from "@lexical/react/LexicalContentEditable";
      import { LexicalErrorBoundary } from "@lexical/react/LexicalErrorBoundary";
      import {
        liveblocksConfig,
        LiveblocksPlugin,
        FloatingComposer,
      } from "@liveblocks/react-lexical";

      export function Editor() {
        // Wrap your Lexical config with `liveblocksConfig`
        const initialConfig = liveblocksConfig({
          namespace: "Demo",
          onError: (error: unknown) => {
            console.error(error);
            throw error;
          },
        });

        return (
          <LexicalComposer initialConfig={initialConfig}>
            <RichTextPlugin
              contentEditable={<ContentEditable />}
              placeholder={
                <div>Start typing here…</div>
              }
              ErrorBoundary={LexicalErrorBoundary}
            />
            <LiveblocksPlugin>
              <FloatingComposer />
            </LiveblocksPlugin>
          </LexicalComposer>
        );
      }
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Import default styles</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The default components come with default styles, you can import them into the
      root layout of your app or directly into a CSS file with `@import`.

      ```tsx
      import "@liveblocks/react-ui/styles.css";
      import "@liveblocks/react-lexical/styles.css";
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Next: authenticate and add your users</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      Text Editor is set up and working now, but each user is anonymous—the next step is to
      authenticate each user as they connect, and attach their name, color, and avatar, to their cursors and mentions.

        </a>
      </Button>
    </StepContent>
