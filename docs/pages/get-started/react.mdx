In this guide, we’ll be learning how to add collaboration to React using the
Liveblocks custom hooks. The hooks are part of [`@liveblocks/react`][], a
package enabling multiplayer experiences in a matter of minutes.

If you’re using a state-management library such as
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand),
we recommend reading one of our dedicated guides:

- [React + Redux guide](/docs/get-started/react-redux)
- [React + Zustand guide](/docs/get-started/react-zustand)

You can also
[follow our step-by-step tutorial](/docs/tutorials/multiplayer-to-do-list/react)
to learn how to use Liveblocks.

## Install Liveblocks into your project [#install-liveblocks]

### Install Liveblocks packages

Run the following command to install the Liveblocks packages:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react
```

[`@liveblocks/client`][] lets you interact with Liveblocks servers.  
[`@liveblocks/react`][] contains React providers and hooks to make it easier to
consume `@liveblocks/client`.

### Connect to Liveblocks servers [#connect-liveblocks-servers]

In order to use Liveblocks, we’ll need to sign up and get an API key.
[Create an account](/api/auth/signup), then navigate to
[the dashboard](/dashboard/apikeys) to find your public key (it starts with
`pk_`).

Let’s now add a new file `src/liveblocks.config.js` in our application to create
a Liveblocks client using the public key as shown below.

```jsx file="liveblocks.config.js"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});
```

### Connect to a Liveblocks room [#connect-liveblocks-room]

Liveblocks uses the concept of _rooms_, separate virtual spaces where people can
collaborate. To create a multiplayer experience, multiple users must be
connected to the same room.

Instead of using the client directly, we’re going to use [`createRoomContext`][]
from `@liveblocks/react` to create a [`RoomProvider`][] and hooks to make it
easy to consume from our components.

```jsx file="src/liveblocks.config.js" highlight="2,8-10"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { createRoomContext } from "@liveblocks/react";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});

export const { RoomProvider } = createRoomContext(client);
```

You might be wondering why we’re creating our Providers and Hooks with
`createRoomContext` instead of importing them directly from
`@liveblocks/client`. This allows TypeScript users to define their Liveblocks
types once in one unique location—allowing them to get a great autocompletion
experience when using those hooks elsewhere.

We can now import the `RoomProvider` directly from our
`src/liveblocks.config.js` file. The `RoomProvider` takes a room `id` as a
property, this being the unique reference for the room. For this tutorial we’ll
use `"my-room-id"` as our `id`. When the `RoomProvider` renders, the current
user enters the room `"my-room-id"` and leaves it when it unmounts.

```jsx file="src/index.js" highlight="7,11"
import App from "./App";
import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";
import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config.js";

function Index() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider id="my-room-id" initialPresence={{}}>
      <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {() => <App />}
      </ClientSideSuspense>
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

You may also notice that we’re using `ClientSideSuspense` from
`@liveblocks/react` in this example. This is a component that adds React’s
[Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#suspense) feature by wrapping
our app in a Suspense boundary. Doing so enables the suspense version of our
hooks—an option we recommend using for simpler component code.

The component passed to the `fallback` property will be displayed until
Liveblocks is connected and ready to go. `ClientSideSuspense` can also be moved
further down the tree, so that specific parts of your app load exactly when
ready.

<Banner title="ClientSideSuspense">

If you’re familiar with Suspense, you may be wondering why we’re using
`ClientSideSuspense` from @liveblocks/react instead of the normal `Suspense`
component from React itself. This is only done so this tutorial will also work
in projects that use server-side rendering (e.g. in a Next.js project). You may
not strictly need it. Details can be found
[here](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#suspense-boundary-setup) if you’re
interested.

## Get other users in the room [#get-others]

Now that the provider is set up, we can start using the Liveblocks hooks. The
first we’ll add is [`useOthers`][], a hook that provides us information about
which _other_ users are connected to the room.

We can re-export this from `liveblocks.config.js`, and because we’re using
suspense in this example, we’ll export all our hooks from the `suspense`
property.

```jsx file="liveblocks.config.js" highlight="11"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { createRoomContext } from "@liveblocks/react";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});

export const {
  suspense: {
    RoomProvider,
    useOthers, // 👈
  },
} = createRoomContext(client);
```

To show how many other users are in the room, import `useOthers` into a
component and use it as below.

```jsx highlight="4"
import { useOthers } from "./liveblocks.config";

function App() {
  const others = useOthers();

  return <div>There are {others.count} other users with you in the room.</div>;
}
```

Great! We’re connected, and we already have information about the other users
currently online.

## Define initial presence [#define-presence]

Most collaborative features rely on each user having their own temporary state,
which is then shared with others. For example, in an app using multiplayer
cursors, the location of each user’s cursor will be their state. In Liveblocks,
we call this _presence_.

We can use _presence_ to hold any object that we wish to share with others. An
example would be the pixel coordinates of a user’s cursor:

```js
cursor: { x: 256, y: 367 }
```

To start using presence, first we must define an `initialPresence` value on our
`RoomProvider`. We’ll set the initial cursor to `null` to represent a user whose
cursor is currently off-screen.

```jsx file="src/index.js" highlight="7"
import App from "./App";
import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";
import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config.js";

function Index() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider id="my-room-id" initialPresence={{ cursor: null }}>
      <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {() => <App />}
      </ClientSideSuspense>
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

## Update user presence [#update-presence]

We can add the [`useUpdateMyPresence`][] hook to share this information in
real-time, and in this case, update the current user cursor position when
`onPointerMove` is called.

First, re-export `useUpdateMyPresence` like we did with `useOthers`.

```jsx file="liveblocks.config.js" highlight="7"
// ...

export const {
  suspense: {
    RoomProvider,
    useOthers,
    useUpdateMyPresence, // 👈
  },
} = createRoomContext(client);
```

To keep this guide concise, we’ll assume that you now understand how to
re-export your hooks for every new hook.

Next, import `updateMyPresence` and call it with the updated cursor coordinates
whenever a pointer move event is detected.

```jsx
import { useUpdateMyPresence } from "./liveblocks.config";

function App() {
  const updateMyPresence = useUpdateMyPresence();

  return (
    <div
      style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}
      onPointerMove={(e) =>
        updateMyPresence({ cursor: { x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY } })
      }
      onPointerLeave={() => updateMyPresence({ cursor: null })}
    />
  );
}
```

We’re setting `cursor` to `null` when the user’s pointer leaves the element.

## Get other users’ presence [#get-others-presence]

To retrieve each user’s presence, and cursor locations, we can once again add
[`useOthers`][]. This time we’ll use a selector function to map through each
user’s presence, and grab their cursor property. If a cursor is set to `null`, a
user is off-screen, so we’ll skip rendering it.

```jsx
import { useOthers } from "./liveblocks.config";

function App() {
  // List of other users
  const others = useOthers();

  // If a cursor is on screen (not null), render
  return (
    <>
      {others.map(({ connectionId, presence }) =>
        presence.cursor ? (
          <Cursor
            key={connectionId}
            x={presence.cursor.x}
            y={presence.cursor.y}
          />
        ) : null
      )}
    </>
  );
}

// Basic cursor component
function Cursor({ x, y }) {
  return (
    <img
      style={{
        position: "absolute",
        transform: `translate(${x}px, ${y}px)`,
      }}
      src="cursor-image.svg"
    />
  );
}
```

Presence isn’t only for [multiplayer cursors](/examples/browse/cursors), and can
be helpful for a number of other use cases such as
[live avatar stacks](/examples/browse/avatar-stack) and
[real-time form presence](/examples/browse/forms).

## Sync and persist the state across client [#storage-intro]

Some collaborative features require a single shared state between all users—an
example of this would be a
[collaborative design tool](/examples/browse/whiteboard), with each shape having
its own state, or a form with shared inputs. In Liveblocks, this is where
`storage` comes in. Room storage automatically updates for every user on
changes, and unlike presence, persists after users disconnect.

### Storage types

Our storage uses special data structures (inspired by
[CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)) to
resolve all conflicts, meaning that state is always accurate. There are
[multiple storage types](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Storage)
available:

- [`LiveObject`][] - Similar to a JavaScript object.
- [`LiveList`][] - An array-like ordered collection of items.
- [`LiveMap`][] - Similar to a JavaScript Map.

### Defining initial storage [#initial-storage]

To use storage, first we need to define the initial structure within
[`RoomProvider`][]. In this example we’ll define a [`LiveObject`][] called
`scientist`, containing first and last name properties.

```jsx file="src/index.js" highlight="11-16"
import App from "./App";
import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";
import { LiveObject } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config.js";

function Index() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider
      id="my-room-id"
      initialPresence={/* ... */}
      initialStorage={{
        scientist: new LiveObject({
          firstName: "Marie",
          lastName: "Curie",
        }),
      }}
    >
      <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {() => <App />}
      </ClientSideSuspense>
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

### Using storage

Once the default structure is defined, we can then make use of our storage. The
[`useStorage`][] hook allows us to access an immutable version of our storage
using a selector function.

```jsx highlight="4,8,9"
import { useStorage } from "./liveblocks.config";

function YourComponent() {
  const scientist = useStorage((root) => root.scientist);

  return (
    <>
      <input value={scientist.firstName} />
      <input value={scientist.lastName} />
    </>
  );
}
```

The two input values will now automatically update in a real-time as `firstName`
and `lastName` are modified by other users.

### Updating storage

The best way to update storage is through mutations. The [`useMutation`][] hook
allows you to create reusable callback functions that modify Liveblocks state.
For example, let’s create a mutation that can modify the scientist’s name.

Inside this mutation we’re accessing the storage root, a [`LiveObject`][] like
`scientist`, and retrieving a mutable copy of `scientist` with
[`LiveObject.get`]. From there, we can set the updated name using
[`LiveObject.set`].

```jsx
// Define mutation
const updateName = useMutation(({ storage }, nameType, newName) => {
  const mutableScientist = storage.get("scientist");
  mutableScientist.set(nameType, newName);
}, []);
```

We can then call this mutation, and pass `nameType` and `newName` arguments.

```jsx
updateName("firstName", "Albert");
```

If we take a look at this in the context of a component, we can see how to
combine [`useStorage`][] to display the names, and [`useMutation`][] to modify
them. Note that `useMutation` takes a dependency array, and works similarly to
`useCallback`.

```jsx highlight="6-9,15,19"
import { useStorage } from "./liveblocks.config";

function YourComponent() {
  const scientist = useStorage((root) => root.scientist);

  const updateName = useMutation(({ storage }, nameType, newName) => {
    const mutableScientist = storage.get("scientist");
    mutableScientist.set(nameType, newName);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={scientist.firstName}
        onChange={(e) => updateName("firstName", e.target.value)}
      />
      <input
        value={scientist.lastName}
        onChange={(e) => updateName("lastName", e.target.value)}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

All changes made within `useMutation` are automatically batched and sent to the
Liveblocks together. `useMutation` can also be used to retrieve and modify
presence too, giving you access to multiple parameters, not just `storage`.

```jsx
useMutation({ storage, self, others, setMyPresence });
```

Find more information in the
[Mutations](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMutation) section of our
documentation.

### Nested data structures

With Liveblocks storage, it’s possible to nest data structures inside each
other, for example `scientist` could hold a [`LiveList`][] containing a list of
pets.

```jsx highlight="3"
initialStorage={{
  scientist: new LiveObject({
    pets: new LiveList(["🐶", "🐱", "🐷"]),
    firstName: "Marie",
    lastName: "Curie",
  })
}}
```

Because the `useStorage` selector converts your data structure into a normal
immutable JavaScript structure (made from objects, arrays, maps), `pets` can be
accessed directly with `useStorage`.

```jsx
// ["🐶", "🐱", "🐷"]
const pets = useStorage((root) => root.scientist.pets);
```

You can even reach into a `LiveObject` or `LiveList` and extract a property.

```jsx
// "Marie"
const firstName = useStorage((root) => root.scientist.firstName);

// "🐶"
const firstPet = useStorage((root) => root.scientist.pets[0]);
```

### Improving storage performance

`useStorage` is highly efficient and only triggers a rerender when the value
returned from the selector changes. For example, the following selectors will
only trigger rerenders when their respective values change, and are unaffected
by any other storage updates.

```jsx
// ✅ Rerenders only when root.scientist.firstName changes
const firstName = useStorage((root) => root.scientist.firstName);

// ✅ Rerenders only when root.scientist changes
const scientist = useStorage((root) => root.scientist);
```

However, selector functions must return a stable result to be efficient—if a new
object is created within the selector function, it will rerender on every
storage change.

```jsx
// ❌ Rerenders on every change because `map` returns a new array every time
const pets = useStorage((root) => root.scientist.pets.map((pet) => pet + pet));
```

To account for this, we can pass a `shallow` equality check function, provided
by `@liveblocks/react`:

```jsx highlight="1,6"
import { shallow } from "@liveblocks/react";

// ✅ Rerenders only when root.scientist.pets shallowly changes
const pets = useStorage(
  (root) => root.scientist.pets.map((pet) => pet + pet),
  shallow
);
```

Find more information in the
[How selectors work](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#selectors) section of
our documentation.

## Multiplayer undo/redo [#undo-redo]

Implementing undo/redo in a multiplayer environment is
[notoriously complex](/blog/how-to-build-undo-redo-in-a-multiplayer-environment),
but Liveblocks provides functions to handle it for you. `useUndo` and `useRedo`
return functions that allow you to undo and redo the last changes made to your
app.

```jsx highlight="4,5,9,10"
import { useUndo, useRedo } from "./liveblocks.config";

function App() {
  const undo = useUndo();
  const redo = useRedo();

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => undo()}>Undo</button>
      <button onClick={() => redo()}>Redo</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

An example of this in use would be a button that updates the current `firstName`
of a scientist. Every time a Liveblocks storage change is detected, in this case
`.set` being called, it’s stored. Pressing the undo button will change the name
back to its previous value.

```jsx highlight="6,9,15,16"
import { useState } from "react";
import { useMutation, useUndo } from "./liveblocks.config";

function YourComponent() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  const undo = useUndo();

  const updateName = useMutation(({ storage }, newName) => {
    storage.get("scientist").set("firstName", newName);
  });

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => updateName(text)}>Update Name</button>
      <button onClick={() => undo()}></button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Multiplayer undo/redo is much more complex that it sounds—if you’re interested
in the technical details, you can find more information in our interactive
article:
[How to build undo/redo in a multiplayer environment](/blog/how-to-build-undo-redo-in-a-multiplayer-environment).

### Pause and resume history [#pause-resume]

Sometimes it can be helpful to pause undo/redo history, so that multiple updates
are reverted with a single call.

For example, let’s consider a design tool; when a user drags a rectangle, the
intermediate rectangle positions should not be part of the undo/redo history,
otherwise pressing `undo` may only move the rectangle one pixel backwards.
However, these small pixel updates should still be transmitted to others, so
that the transition is smooth.

`useHistory` is a hook that allows us to pause and resume history states as we
please.

```jsx highlight="4,8,9"
import { useHistory } from "./liveblocks.config";

function App() {
  const { resume, pause } = useHistory();

  return <Rectangle onDragStart={() => pause()} onDragEnd={() => resume()} />;
}
```

### Presence history

By default, undo/redo only impacts the room storage—there’s generally no need to
use it with presence, for example there’s no reason to undo the position of a
user’s cursor. However, occasionally it can be useful.

If we explore the design tool scenario, the currently selected rectangle may be
stored in a user’s presence. If `undo` is pressed, and the rectangle is moved
back, it would make sense to remove the user’s selection on that rectangle.

To enable this, we can use the `addToHistory` option when updating the user’s
presence.

```jsx highlight="4,9"
import { useUpdateMyPresence } from "./liveblocks.config";

function App() {
  const updateMyPresence = useUpdateMyPresence();

  return (
    <Rectangle
      onClick={(rectangleId) =>
        updateMyPresence({ selected: rectangleId }, { addToHistory: true })
      }
    />
  );
}
```

This also works in mutations with `setMyPresence`.

```jsx highlight="4"
import { useMutation } from "./liveblocks.config";

const updateSelected = useMutation(({ setMyPresence }, rectangleId) => {
  setMyPresence({ selected: rectangleId }, { addToHistory: true });
});
```
