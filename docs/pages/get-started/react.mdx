Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding
collaboration to your React application using the hooks from the
[`@liveblocks/react`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react) package.

## Quickstart

<Steps
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Install Liveblocks",
      code: {
        language: "bash",
        code: `npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: (
        <>
          Initialize the <code>liveblocks.config.ts</code> file
        </>
      ),
      code: {
        language: "bash",
        code: `npm create-liveblocks-app@latest --init --react`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Set up the client",
      description: (
        <>
          The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which
          will be responsible for communicating with the back end. You can do
          this by modifying <code>createClient</code> in your config file, and
          passing your public API key.
        </>
      ),
      code: {
        file: "liveblocks.config.ts",
        language: "ts",
        code: `const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Join a Liveblocks room",
      description: `Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people collaborate. To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be connected to the same room.`,
      code: {
        file: "App.tsx",
        language: "ts",
        highlight: "7-11",
        code: `import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";
import { Room } from "./Room";
import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider id="my-room" initialPresence={{}}>
      <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
        {() => <Room />}
      </ClientSideSuspense>
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Use the Liveblocks hooks",
      description: `Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks hooks. The first we’ll add is useOthers, a hook that provides information about which other users are connected to the room.`,
      code: {
        file: "Room.tsx",
        language: "ts",
        highlight: "4",
        code: `import { useOthers } from "./liveblocks.config";
        
export function Room() {
  const others = useOthers();
  const userCount = others.length;
  return <div>There are {userCount} other user(s) online</div>;
}`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Bonus: set up authentication",
      description: (
        <>
          By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication
          endpoint. This approach is great for prototyping and marketing pages
          where defining your own security isn’t always required. If you want to
          implement your own security logic to define if certain users should
          have access to a given room, you’ll need to implement an
          authentication endpoint.
        </>

        href: "/docs/rooms/authentication",
        label: "Set up authentication",
      },
    },
]} />
