Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding
collaboration to your JavaScript application using the APIs from the
[`@liveblocks/client`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client) package.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install Liveblocks</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/client
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the Liveblocks client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which
      will be responsible for communicating with the back end.

      ```ts file="room.js"
      const client = createClient({
        publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Join a Liveblocks room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people collaborate.
      To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be connected to the same room.

      ```js file="room.js"
      const room = client.enter("my-room", { initialPresence: {} });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Use the Liveblocks methods</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using Liveblocks subscriptions.
      The first we’ll add is `others`, a subscription that provides information
      about which other users are connected to the room.

      ```js file="index.js" highlight="5-7"
      import { room } from "./room.js"

      const div = document.querySelector("div");

      room.subscribe("others", (others) => {
        div.innerText = `There are ${others.length} other user(s) online`;
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Next: set up authentication</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    
      By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication endpoint
      where everyone automatically has access to rooms. This approach is great for
      prototyping and marketing pages where setting up your own security isn’t always
      required. If you want to limit access to a room for certain users, you’ll need
      to set up an authentication endpoint to enable permissions.
