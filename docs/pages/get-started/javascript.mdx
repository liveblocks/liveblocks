In this guide, you’ll learn how to use integrate Liveblocks into your JavaScript
application. The `@liveblocks/client` package provides the Liveblocks Presence
and Storage APIs you’ll be integrating with. If you’re using a UI framework such
as React or Vue.js, we recommend reading with our dedicated guides below:

- [React guide][]
- [Vue.js guide][]

This guide assumes that you’re already familiar with JavaScript and that you
already have a way to bundle your JavaScript code for the client.

## Install Liveblocks into your project [#install]

### Install the Liveblocks client package [#setup]

Run the following command to install the Liveblocks client package:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client
```

[`@liveblocks/client`][] lets you connect to Liveblocks servers.

### Connect to Liveblocks

To connect to Liveblocks, you need to create a Liveblocks client with
[`createClient`][] from the front-end.

```js
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

// Create a Liveblocks client
// Replace this key with your public key provided at
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});
```

Liveblocks should now be installed into your project!

## Connect to a Liveblocks room [#connect-room]

A room is the virtual space where people collaborate. To create a multiplayer
experience, you’ll need to connect your users to a Liveblocks room following the
instructions below.

### Using Client.enter to connect to a room [#client-enter]

You can easily connect to a room by using [`client.enter`][] as shown below.

```js
const room = client.enter("your-room-id", { initialPresence: {} });
```

### Using Liveblocks Client methods [#client-methods]

Now that we have our room setup, we can start using Liveblocks Client methods to
share any kind of data between users. For instance, [`Room.subscribe.others`][]
allows us to subscribe to the other users updates.

```js
const room = client.enter("your-room-id", { initialPresence: {} });

const container = document.getElementById("root-container");

room.subscribe("others", (others) => {
  if (others.count === 0) {
    container.innerHTML = "You're the only one here.";
  } else if (others.count === 1) {
    container.innerHTML = "There is one other person here.";
  } else {
    container.innerHTML = "There are " + others.count + " other people here.";
  }
});
```

## Bonus: setup authentication endpoint [#authentication]

Using the public key allows you to use Liveblocks without implementing your own
authentication endpoint. It’s great for prototyping and marketing websites.

If you want to implement your own security and define if the current user has
access to a specific room, you can follow the [Authentication guide][].

If you are using Express, you can also check the [Express Authentication
guide][].
