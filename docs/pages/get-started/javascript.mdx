Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding
collaboration to your JavaScript application using the APIs from the
[`@liveblocks/client`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client) package.

## Quickstart

<Steps

    {
      title: "Install Liveblocks",
      code: {
        language: "bash",
        code: `npm install @liveblocks/client`,
      },
    },
    {

          The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which
          will be responsible for communicating with the back end.
        </>
      ),
      code: {
        language: "ts",
        code: `const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Join a Liveblocks room",
      description: `Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people collaborate. To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be connected to the same room.`,
      code: {
        language: "ts",
        code: `const room = client.enter("my-room", { initialPresence: {} });`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Use the Liveblocks methods",
      description: `Now that weâ€™re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks methods.`,
      code: {
        language: "ts",
        code: `const room = client.enter("my-room", { initialPresence: {} });
\r
const container = document.getElementById("root-container");
\r
room.subscribe("others", (others) => {
  if (others.count === 0) {
    container.innerHTML = "You're the only one here.";
  } else if (others.count === 1) {
    container.innerHTML = "There is one other person here.";
  } else {
    container.innerHTML = "There are " + others.count + " other people here.";
  }
});`,
      },
    },
  ]}
/>
