Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding
collaboration to your JavaScript application using the APIs from the
[`@liveblocks/client`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client) package.

## Quickstart

<Steps
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Install Liveblocks",
      code: {
        language: "bash",
        code: `npm install @liveblocks/client`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Set up the client",
      description: (
        <>
          The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which
          will be responsible for communicating with the back end.
        </>
      ),
      code: {
        language: "ts",
        code: `const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Join a Liveblocks room",
      description: `Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people collaborate. To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be connected to the same room.`,
      code: {
        language: "ts",
        code: `const room = client.enter("my-room", { initialPresence: {} });`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Use the Liveblocks methods",
      description: `Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks methods.`,
      code: {
        language: "ts",
        highlight: "5-7",
        code: `import { room } from "./room.js;"
\r
const div = document.querySelector("div");
\r
room.subscribe("others", (others) => {
  div.innerText = \`There are \${others.length} other user(s) online\`;
});`,
      },
    },
    {
      title: "Bonus: set up authentication",
      description: (
        <>
          By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication
          endpoint. This approach is great for prototyping and marketing pages
          where defining your own security isn’t always required. If you want to
          implement your own security logic to define if certain users should
          have access to a given room, you’ll need to implement an
          authentication endpoint.
        </>

      action: {
        href: "/docs/rooms/authentication",
        label: "Set up authentication",
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Next steps

Congratulations! You now have set up the foundation to start building
collaborative experiences for your JavaScript application.
