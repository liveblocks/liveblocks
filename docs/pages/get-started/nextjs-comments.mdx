Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding a
commenting experience to your Next.js `/app` directory application using the
hooks from [`@liveblocks/react`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react) and the
components from
[`@liveblocks/react-comments`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments).

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install Liveblocks</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react @liveblocks/react-comments
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Initialize the `liveblocks.config.ts` file</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --init --framework react
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the Liveblocks client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which
      will be responsible for communicating with the back end. You can do
      this by modifying `createClient` in your config file, and
      passing your public API key.

      ```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts"
      const client = createClient({
        publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Join a Liveblocks room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people
      collaborate. To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be
      connected to the same room. When using Next.js’ `/app`
      directory, we recommend creating your room in a `Room.tsx`
      file in the same directory as your current route.

      ```tsx file="app/Room.tsx" highlight="9-13"
      "use client";

      import { ReactNode } from "react";
      import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";
      import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";

      export function Room({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
        return (
          <RoomProvider id="my-room" initialPresence={{}}>
            <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
              {() => children}
            </ClientSideSuspense>
          </RoomProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Add the Liveblocks room to your page</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      After creating your room file, it’s time to join it. Import
      your room into your `page.tsx` file, and place
      your collaborative app components inside it.

      ```tsx file="app/page.tsx" highlight="6-8"
      import { Room } from "./Room";
      import { CollaborativeApp } from "./CollaborativeApp";

      export default function Page() {
        return (
          <Room>
            <CollaborativeApp />
          </Room>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Use the Liveblocks hooks and components</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks hooks and components.
      We’ll add `useThreads` to get the threads in the room, then we’ll use the `Thread` component
      to render them. Finally, we’ll add a way to create threads by adding a `Composer`.

      ```tsx file="app/CollaborativeApp.tsx" highlight="7,11-14"
      "use client";

      import { useThreads } from "./liveblocks.config";
      import { Composer, Thread } from "@liveblocks/react-comments";

      export function CollaborativeApp() {
        const { threads } = useThreads();

        return (
          <div>
            {threads.map((thread) => (
              <Thread key={thread.id} thread={thread} />
            ))}
            <Composer />
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
   <Step>
    <StepTitle>Import default styles</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

    The default components come with default styles, you can import them into the
    root layout of your app or directly into a CSS file with `@import`.

    ```tsx file="app/layout.tsx"
    import "@liveblocks/react-comments/styles.css";
    ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Next: set up authentication</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication endpoint
      where everyone automatically has access to rooms and where users are assigned a random ID. This approach is great for
      prototyping where setting up your own security isn’t always
      required. If you want to start using real user IDs and permissions, you’ll need
      to set up an authentication endpoint.
