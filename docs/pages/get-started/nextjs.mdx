Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding
collaboration to your Next.js `/app` directory application using the hooks from
the [`@liveblocks/react`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react) package.

## Quickstart

<Steps>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install Liveblocks</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Initialize the `liveblocks.config.ts` file</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --init --framework react
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the Liveblocks client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which
      will be responsible for communicating with the back end. You can do
      this by modifying `createClient` in your config file, and
      passing your public API key.

      ```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts"
      const client = createClient({
        publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Create a Liveblocks room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where
      collaborate. To create a real-time experience, multiple users must
      be connected to the same room. When using Next.js’ `/app`
      directory, we recommend creating your room in a `Room.tsx`
      file in the same directory as your current route.

      ```tsx file="app/Room.tsx" highlight="9-13"
      "use client";

      import { ReactNode } from "react";
      import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";
      import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";

      export function Room({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
        return (
          <RoomProvider id="my-room" initialPresence={{}}>
            <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
              {() => children}
            </ClientSideSuspense>
          </RoomProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Add the Liveblocks room to your page</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      After creating your room file, it’s time to join it. Import
      your room into your `page.tsx` file, and place
      your collaborative app components inside it.

      ```tsx file="app/page.tsx" highlight="6-8"
      import { Room } from "./Room";
      import { CollaborativeApp } from "./CollaborativeApp";

      export default function Page() {
        return (
          <Room>
            <CollaborativeApp />
          </Room>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Use the Liveblocks hooks</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks hooks.
      The first we’ll add is useOthers, a hook that provides information
      about which other users are connected to the room.

      ```tsx file="app/CollaborativeApp.tsx" highlight="6"
      "use client";

      import { useOthers } from "./liveblocks.config";

      export function CollaborativeApp() {
        const others = useOthers();
        const userCount = others.length;
        return <div>There are {userCount} other user(s) online</div>;
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Next: set up authentication</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    
      By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication endpoint
      where everyone automatically has access to rooms. This approach is great for
      prototyping and marketing pages where setting up your own security isn’t always
      required. If you want to limit access to a room for certain users, you’ll need
      to set up an authentication endpoint to enable permissions.

      <ButtonLink className="not-markdown" href="/docs/rooms/authentication">
        Set up authentication
      </ButtonLink>
    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>
