Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start making your
Zustand store multiplayer by using the middleware from the
[`@liveblocks/zustand`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-zustand) package.

## Quickstart

          Create the Liveblocks client and use the <code>middleware</code> in your
          Zustand store setup. This will add a new state called{" "}
          <code>liveblocks</code> to your store, enabling you to interact with
          our Presence and Storage APIs.
