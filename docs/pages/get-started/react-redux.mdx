In this guide, you’ll learn how to use integrate Liveblocks into your React +
Redux application. The `@liveblocks/redux` package provides a
[store enhancer](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/glossary#store-enhancer)
to turn selected parts of your Redux store into a real‑time shared state between
clients. This approach makes it easy to convert an existing non-collaborative
application into one. It also enables you to keep your front-end architecture
without sprinkling Liveblocks code all over your code base.

If you’re not using a state-management library, we recommend reading our
dedicated React guide below:

- [React guide][]

You can also
[follow our step-by-step tutorial](/docs/tutorials/collaborative-to-do-list/react-redux)
to learn how to use Liveblocks.

## Install Liveblocks into your project [#install-liveblocks]

Create a new app with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) and
once the installation is complete, run the following command to install
Liveblocks dependencies:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/redux redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit
```

## Connect to Liveblocks

You’ll need an API key in order to use Liveblocks.
[Create a Liveblocks account](/api/auth/signup) to get
[your API key](/dashboard/apikeys). It should start with pk\_.

Then, create a client with [`createClient`][] and set your public key as shown
below.

```jsx
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});
```

## Setup your Liveblocks real‑time enhancer [#setup-enhancer]

Use our `enhancer` in your store setup and pass the client created previously as
the configuration. This will add a new state called `liveblocks` to your store,
enabling you to interact with our Presence and Storage APIs.

```jsx file="src/store.js"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { enhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";
import { configureStore, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
});

const initialState = {};

const slice = createSlice({
  name: "state",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    /* logic will be added here */
  },
});

function makeStore() {
  return configureStore({
    reducer: slice.reducer,
    enhancers: [
      enhancer({
        client,
      }),
    ],
  });
}

const store = makeStore();

export default store;
```

Then setup your redux store at the top of your React tree.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## Connect to a Liveblocks room [#connect-to-room]

A room is the virtual space where people collaborate. To create a multiplayer
experience, you’ll need to connect your users to a Liveblocks room.

Dispatch `enterRoom` to start syncing parts of your store to the Liveblocks room
and dispatch `leaveRoom` to stop the synchronization. With React `useEffect`,
you can automatically enter and leave a Liveblocks room as your component is
mounting and unmounting.

```jsx file="src/App.js"
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { actions } from "@liveblocks/redux";

import "./App.css";

export default function App() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(actions.enterRoom("room-id"));

    return () => {
      dispatch(actions.leaveRoom("room-id"));
    };
  }, [dispatch]);

  return <div className="container">To-do App</div>;
}
```

## Get other users in the room [#get-others]

<Banner title="Need help troubleshooting presence?">

Try the [Liveblocks DevTools extension](/devtools) to visualize your
collaborative experiences as you build them, in real-time.

</Banner>

If you want to list all the people connected to the room, you can use
`state.liveblocks.others` to get an array of the other users in the room.

```jsx
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

function App() {
  const others = useSelector((state) => state.liveblocks.others);
}
```

## Update user presence [#update-presence]

To create immersive multiplayer experiences, it’s helpful for each person in the
room to share their real‑time state with other connected users. That real‑time
state often corresponds to a cursor position or even the item a user has
currently selected. We call this concept "Presence".

For instance, to share the cursor’s position in real‑time with others, we’re
going to add a new `presenceMapping` option to our `enhancer` to specify which
part of the state maps to the current user’s `presence`.

```jsx file="src/store.js"
/* ... imports and client setup ... */

const initialState = {
  cursor: { x: 0, y: 0 },
};

const slice = createSlice({
  name: "state",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setCursor: (state, action) => {
      state.cursor = action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { setCursor } = slice.actions;

function makeStore() {
  return configureStore({
    reducer: slice.reducer,
    enhancers: [
      enhancer({
        client,
        presenceMapping: { cursor: true },
      }),
    ],
  });
}

const store = makeStore();

export default store;
```

Then you can dispatch an action like in any redux app and we will broadcast this
cursor to everyone in the room.

```jsx
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { setCursor } from "./store.js";

function YourComponent() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div
      style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}
      onPointerMove={(e) => dispatch(setCursor({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY }))}
    />
  );
}
```

## Get other users’ presence [#get-others-presence]

Get people’s cursor positions with
`liveblocks.others.map(user => user.presence?.cursor)`. It’s worth noting that a
user presence can be `undefined`.

```jsx
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

function OthersCursors() {
  const others = useSelector((state) => state.liveblocks.others);

  const othersCursors = others.map((user) => user.presence?.cursor);

  // Render cursors with custom SVGs based on x and y
}
```

## Sync and persist the state across client [#storage-intro]

<Banner title="Need help troubleshooting storage?">

Try the [Liveblocks DevTools extension](/devtools) to visualize your
collaborative experiences as you build them, in real-time.

</Banner>

As opposed to the `presence`, some collaborative features require that every
user interacts with the same piece of state. For example, in Google Docs, it is
the paragraphs, headings, images in the document. In Figma, it’s all the shapes
that make your design. That’s what we call the room’s `storage`.

The room’s storage is a conflicts-free state that multiple users can edit at the
same time. It is persisted to our backend even after everyone leaves the room.
Liveblocks provides custom data structures inspired by
[CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) that
can be nested to create the state that you want.

- [`LiveObject`][] - Similar to JavaScript object. If multiple users update the
  same property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
  servers is the winner.
- [`LiveList`][] - An ordered collection of items synchronized across clients.
  Even if multiple users add/remove/move elements simultaneously, LiveList will
  solve the conflicts to ensure everyone sees the same collection of items.
- [`LiveMap`][] - Similar to a JavaScript Map. If multiple users update the same
  property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
  servers is the winner.

When using our redux integration you cannot to interact directly with these data
structures. Our enhancer synchronizes your store with our data structures based
on the `storageMapping` configuration.

Here is an example to explain how it works under the hood. Imagine you have the
following store:

```js
/* ...client setup... */

const initialState = {
  firstName: "Marie",
  lastName: "Curie",
  discoveries: ["Polonium", "Radium"],
};

const slice = createSlice({
  name: "state",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setFirstName: (state, action) => {
      state.firstName = action.payload;
    },
    setLastName: (state, action) => {
      state.lastName = action.payload;
    },
    addDiscovery: (state, action) => {
      state.discoveries.push(action.payload);
    },
  },
});

export const { setScientist } = slice.actions;

function makeStore() {
  return configureStore({
    reducer: slice.reducer,
    enhancers: [
      enhancer({
        client,
        storageMapping: { firstName: true, lastName: true, discoveries: true },
      }),
    ],
  });
}

const store = makeStore();
```

With this setup, the room's `storage` root is :

```js
const root = new LiveObject({
  firstName: "Marie",
  lastName: "Curie",
  discoveries: new LiveList(["Polonium", "Radium"]),
});
```

If you update your store by dispatching `setFirstName("Pierre")`, the enhancer
will do `root.set("firstName", "Pierre")` for you and update the store of all
the users currently connected to the room. The enhancer compares the previous
state and the new state to detect changes and patch our data structures
accordingly.

The reverse process happens when receiving updates from other clients; the
enhancer patches your immutable state.

When entering a room with `enterRoom`, the enhancer fetches the room's storage
from our server and patches your store. If this is the first time you're
entering a room, the storage will be empty. `enterRoom` takes an additional
argument to initialize the room's storage.

```js
enterRoom("room-id", {
  firstName: "Lise",
  lastName: "Meitner",
  discoveries: ["Nuclear fission", "Protactinium"],
});
```

## Multiplayer undo/redo [#undo-redo]

Implementing undo/redo when multiple users can edit the app state simultaneously
is quite complex!

**When only one user can edit the app state, undo/redo acts like a "time
machine"**; undo/redo replaces the current app state with an app state that was
already be seen by the user.

When multiple users are involved, undo or redo can lead to an app state that no
one has seen before. For example, let's imagine a design tool with two users
editing the same circle.

- Initial state => `{ radius: "10px", color: "yellow" }`
- User A sets the `color` to `blue` => `{ radius: "10px", color: "blue" }`
- User B sets the `radius` to `20px` => `{ radius: "20px", color: "blue" }`
- User A realizes that it prefered the circle in yellow and undoes **its last
  modification** => `{ radius: "20px", color: "yellow" }`

A yellow circle with a radius of 20px in a completely new state. **Undo/redo in
a multiplayer app does not act like a "time machine"; it only undoes local
operation**.

The good news is that [`room.history.undo`][] and [`room.history.redo`][] takes
that complexity out of your hands so you can focus on the core features of your
app.

Access these two functions from the client like below so you can easily bind
them to keyboard events (⌘+Z/⌘+⇧+Z on Mac and Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y on Windows) or undo
and redo buttons in your application..

```js
const { undo, redo } = client.getRoom("room-id").history;
```

### Pause and resume history [#pause-resume]

Some applications require skipping intermediate states from the undo/redo
history. Let's consider a design tool; when a user drags a rectangle, the
intermediate rectangle positions should not be part of the undo/redo history.
But they should be shared with the rest of the room to create a great
experience.

[`room.history.pause`][] and [`room.history.resume`][] lets you skip these
intermediate states. To go back to our design tool example, the sequence of
calls would look like that:

- User presses the rectangle
- Call `room.history.pause` to skip future operations from the history
- User drags the rectangle
- User release the rectangle
- Call `room.history.resume`

At this point, if the user calls `room.history.undo`, the rectangle will go back
to its initial position.

```js
const { pause, resume } = client.getRoom("room-id").history;
```
