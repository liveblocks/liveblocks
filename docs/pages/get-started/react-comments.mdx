    "Learn how to get started with Comments using Liveblocks and React"

Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding a
commenting experience to your React application using the hooks from
[`@liveblocks/react`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react) and the components
from
[`@liveblocks/react-comments`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments).

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install Liveblocks</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react @liveblocks/react-comments
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Initialize the `liveblocks.config.ts` file</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --init --framework react
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the Liveblocks client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which
      will be responsible for communicating with the back end. You can do
      this by modifying `createClient` in your config file, and
      passing your public API key.

      ```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts"
      const client = createClient({
        publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Join a Liveblocks room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people
      collaborate. To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be
      connected to the same room.

      ```tsx file="App.tsx" highlight="7-11"
      import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";
      import { Room } from "./Room";
      import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";

      export default function App() {
        return (
          <RoomProvider id="my-room" initialPresence={{}}>
            <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
              {() => <Room />}
            </ClientSideSuspense>
          </RoomProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Use the Liveblocks hooks and components</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks hooks and components.
      We’ll add `useThreads` to get the threads in the room, then we’ll use the `Thread` component
      to render them. Finally, we’ll add a way to create threads by adding a `Composer`.

      ```tsx file="Room.tsx" highlight="5,9-12"
      import { useThreads } from "./liveblocks.config";
      import { Composer, Thread } from "@liveblocks/react-comments";

      export function Room() {
        const { threads } = useThreads();

        return (
          <div>
            {threads.map((thread) => (
              <Thread key={thread.id} thread={thread} />
            ))}
            <Composer />
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
   <Step>
    <StepTitle>Import default styles</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

    The default components come with default styles, you can import them into the
    root of your app or directly into a CSS file with `@import`.

    ```tsx
    import "@liveblocks/react-comments/styles.css";
    ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Next: authenticate and add your users</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    
      Comments is set up and working now, but each user is anonymous—the next step is to
      authenticate each user as they connect, and attach their name and avatar to their comments.

      <ButtonLink className="not-markdown" href="/docs/guides/how-to-add-users-to-liveblocks-comments">
        Add your users to Comments
      </ButtonLink>
    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>
