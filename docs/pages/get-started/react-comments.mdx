Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Follow the following steps to start adding a
commenting experience to your React application using the hooks from
`@liveblocks/react` and the components from `@liveblocks/react-comments`.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install Liveblocks</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/client@comments @liveblocks/react@comments @liveblocks/react-comments@comments
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Initialize the `liveblocks.config.ts` file</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --init --framework react
      ```

      To get started with comments, you’ll need to export `useThreads`.

      ```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="4"
      export const {
        suspense: {
          RoomProvider,
          useThreads
        },
      } = createRoomContext(client);
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the Liveblocks client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which
      will be responsible for communicating with the back end. You can do
      this by modifying `createClient` in your config file, and
      passing your public API key.

      ```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts"
      const client = createClient({
        publicApiKey: "{{PUBLIC_KEY}}",
      });
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Join a Liveblocks room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people
      collaborate. To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be
      connected to the same room.

      ```tsx file="App.tsx" highlight="7-11"
      import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";
      import { Room } from "./Room";
      import { ClientSideSuspense } from "@liveblocks/react";

      export default function App() {
        return (
          <RoomProvider id="my-room" initialPresence={{}}>
            <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
              {() => <Room />}
            </ClientSideSuspense>
          </RoomProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Use the Liveblocks hooks and components</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks hooks and components.
      We’ll add `useThreads` to get the threads in the room, then we’ll use the `Thread` component
      to render them. Finally, we’ll add a way to create threads by adding a `Composer`.

      ```tsx file="Room.tsx" highlight="5,9,11"
      import { useThreads } from "./liveblocks.config";
      import { Composer, Thread } from "@liveblocks/react-comments";

      export function Room() {
        const threads = useThreads();
        return (
          <div>
            {threads.map((thread) => (
              <Thread key={thread.id} thread={thread} />
            ))}
            <Composer />
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
   <Step>
    <StepTitle>Import default styles</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

    The default components come with default styles, import them either as a module or
    directly in CSS depending on your setup.

    ```tsx file="layout.tsx"
    import "@liveblocks/react-comments/styles.css";
    ```

    ```tsx file="globals.css"
    @import "@liveblocks/react-comments/styles.css";
    ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>
  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Next: set up authentication</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      By default, Liveblocks is configured to work without an authentication endpoint
      where everyone automatically has access to rooms. This approach is great for
      prototyping and marketing pages where setting up your own security isn’t always
      required. If you want to limit access to a room for certain users, you’ll need
      to set up an authentication endpoint to enable permissions.

      TODO: Start explaining user IDs, resolveUser, etc.

      <ButtonLink className="not-markdown" href="/docs/rooms/authentication">
        Set up authentication
      </ButtonLink>
    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>
