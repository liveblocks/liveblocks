Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Liveblocks is built around the following core
concepts: products, rooms, integrations, and platform.

## Products

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution made of the following core products:
[Presence](/docs/products/presence), [Broadcast](/docs/products/broadcast), and
[Storage](/docs/products/storage). You can decide what products you want to use
based on your requirements and collaborative experiences youâ€™re looking to
build.

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate and integrate with the
Liveblocks products. You can require your users to be
[authenticated](/docs/rooms/authentication) to interact with rooms, and each
room can have specific [permissions](/docs/rooms/permissions) and
[metadata](/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

Liveblocks and its community provide integrations that developers can use to
integrate with the Liveblocks products.

WebSocket edge infrastructure that scales to millions of users.
