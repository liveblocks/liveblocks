Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. The foundations of Liveblocks are built upon four
core concepts: products, rooms, integrations, and platform.

## Products

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core products, each
enabling a different facet of collaborative experiences:
[Presence](/docs/products/presence), [Broadcast](/docs/products/broadcast), and
[Storage](/docs/products/storage). You can decide what products you want to use
based on your requirements and collaborative experiences youâ€™re looking to
build.

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. You can require your
users to be [authenticated](/docs/rooms/authentication) to interact with rooms,
and each room can have specific [permissions](/docs/rooms/permissions) and
[metadata](/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

## Integrations

Liveblocks and its community provide integrations that developers can use to
integrate with the Liveblocks products within the rooms. You can use existing
integrations for specific libraries and frameworks, or create a custom one for
your needs.

## Platform

Liveblocks provides a fully-hosted platform built around a WebSocket edge
infrastructure that scales to millions of users. With the platform, you get a
lot of powerful tools such as
[REST APIs](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints),
[webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks), [DevTools](/docs/platform/devtools),
[schema validation](/docs/platform/schema-validation), analytics, and more.
