Liveblocks is the platform for adding collaborative editing, comments, and
notifications into your application.

## Products

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core products, each
enabling a different facet of collaborative experiences:
[Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments),
[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications),
[Text Editor](/docs/ready-made-features/text-editor), and
[Realtime APIs](/docs/ready-made-features/realtime-apis). You can decide what
products you want to use based on your requirements and collaborative
experiences you’re looking to build.

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. You can require your
users to be [authenticated](/docs/authentication) to interact with rooms, and
each room can have specific [permissions](/docs/authentication) and
[metadata](/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

## Projects

A project in your dashboard represents an application which has [rooms](#rooms).
Most Liveblocks products are room-based, however
[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications) is project-based
instead, so that users can receive notifications from other rooms.
