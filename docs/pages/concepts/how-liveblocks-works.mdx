Liveblocks provides customizable pre-built features that boost user engagement
by adding collaboration to your product. All without derailing your roadmap.

## Ready-made features

Liveblocks provides ready‑to‑use features through customizable pre‑built
components that can easily be dropped into your product to boost growth:
[Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments),
[Text Editor](/docs/ready-made-features/text-editor),
[Presence](/docs/ready-made-features/presence), and
[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications). You can decide
features you want to use based on your requirements and collaborative
experiences you’re looking to add.

If you have more advanced needs, you can also leverage Liveblocks to
[host and scale local-first sync engines](/docs/platform/sync-datastore) such as
Liveblocks Storage and Yjs.

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. You can require your
users to be [authenticated](/docs/authentication) to interact with rooms, and
each room can have specific [permissions](/docs/authentication) and
[metadata](/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

## Projects

A project in your dashboard represents an application which has [rooms](#rooms).
Most Liveblocks products are room-based, however
[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications) is project-based
instead, so that users can receive notifications from other rooms.
