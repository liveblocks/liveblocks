Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. The foundations of Liveblocks are built upon four
core concepts: products, rooms, integrations, and platform.

## Products

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core products, each
enabling a different facet of collaborative experiences:
[Presence](/docs/products/presence), [Broadcast](/docs/products/broadcast),

[Document](/docs/products/document), and [Comments](/docs/products/comments)
(private beta). You can decide what products you want to use based on your
requirements and collaborative experiences you’re looking to build.

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. You can require your
users to be [authenticated](/docs/rooms/authentication) to interact with rooms,
and each room can have specific [permissions](/docs/rooms/permissions) and
[metadata](/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

## Integrations

Integrations for specific libraries and frameworks to add Liveblocks-powered
collaborative experiences to your product:
[JavaScript](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client),
[React](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react),
[Redux](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-redux),
[Zustand](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-zustand), and
[Yjs](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-yjs). Integrations are designed to serve
various collaboration use cases such as text editors, comments, creative tools,
forms, and more.

## Platform

Liveblocks provides a fully-hosted platform built around a
[WebSocket infrastructure](/docs/platform/websocket-infrastructure) that scales
effortlessly to millions of users. The platform equips you with a set of
powerful tools such as our [REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints),
[webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks),
[schema validation](/docs/platform/schema-validation),
[analytics](/docs/platform/analytics), and more.
