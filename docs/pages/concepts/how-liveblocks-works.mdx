Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. The foundations of Liveblocks are built upon four
core concepts: products, rooms, integrations, and platform.

## Products

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core products, each
enabling a different facet of collaborative experiences:
[Presence](/docs/products/presence), [Broadcast](/docs/products/broadcast), and
[Storage](/docs/products/storage). You can decide what products you want to use
based on your requirements and collaborative experiences youâ€™re looking to
build.

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate and integrate with the
Liveblocks products. You can require your users to be
[authenticated](/docs/rooms/authentication) to interact with rooms, and each
room can have specific [permissions](/docs/rooms/permissions) and
[metadata](/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

## Integrations

Liveblocks and its community provide integrations that developers can use to
integrate with the Liveblocks products. You can use existing integrations for
specific libraries and frameworks, or create a custom one for your needs.

## Platform

Liveblocks provides a fully-hosted platform built around a WebSocket edge
infrastructure that scales to millions of users. With the platform, you get a
lot of powerful tools such as
[REST APIs](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints),
[webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks), [DevTools](/docs/platform/devtools),
[schema validation](/docs/platform/schema-validation), analytics, and more.
