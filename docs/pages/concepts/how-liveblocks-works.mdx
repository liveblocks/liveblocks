Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. The foundations of Liveblocks are built upon four
core concepts: products, rooms, integrations, and platform.

## Products

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core products, each
enabling a different facet of collaborative experiences:
[Presence](/docs/products/presence), [Broadcast](/docs/products/broadcast),
[Storage](/docs/products/storage), and [Comments](/docs/products/comments). You
can decide what products you want to use based on your requirements and
collaborative experiences you’re looking to build.

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. You can require your
users to be [authenticated](/docs/rooms/authentication) to interact with rooms,
and each room can have specific [permissions](/docs/rooms/permissions) and
[metadata](/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

## Integrations

Liveblocks and its community provide integrations that developers can use to
integrate with the Liveblocks products within the rooms. You can use existing
integrations for specific libraries and frameworks, or create a custom one for
your needs.

- [`@liveblocks/client`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client)
- [`@liveblocks/react`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react)
- [`@liveblocks/redux`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-redux)
- [`@liveblocks/zustand`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-zustand)
- `@liveblocks/react-comments` (private beta)

## Platform

Liveblocks provides a fully-hosted platform built around a
[WebSocket infrastructure](/docs/platform/websocket-infrastructure) that scales
effortlessly to millions of users. With the platform, you get a lot of powerful
tools such as [REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints),
[webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks),
[schema validation](/docs/platform/schema-validation),
[analytics](/docs/platform/analytics), and more.
