Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Liveblocks is built around the following core
concepts: primitives, rooms, integrations, and platform.

## Primitives

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core primitives to embed
collaborative experiences: [Presence](/docs/primitives/presence),
[Broadcast](/docs/primitives/broadcast), and
[Storage](/docs/primitives/storage).

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. Primitives are
associated with dedicated rooms.

## Integrations

Liveblocks and its community provide integrations that developers can use to
integrate with the Liveblocks primitives.

WebSocket edge infrastructure that scales to millions of users.
