Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. Liveblocks is built around the following core
concepts: products, rooms, integrations, and platform.

## Products

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core primitives to embed
collaborative experiences: [Presence](/docs/products/presence),
[Broadcast](/docs/products/broadcast), and [Storage](/docs/products/storage).

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. Products are associated
with dedicated rooms.
