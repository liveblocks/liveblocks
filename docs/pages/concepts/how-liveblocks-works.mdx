Liveblocks is a real-time collaboration infrastructure for building performant
collaborative experiences. As you integrate with Liveblocks, it is important
that you understand the following core concepts:

- Primitives
- Rooms
- Integrations
- Platform

## Primitives

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core primitives to embed
collaborative experiences:

- [Presence](/docs/primitives/presence)
- [Broadcast](/docs/primitives/broadcast)
- [Storage](/docs/primitives/storage)
- [Comments](/docs/primitives/comments)

## Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. Primitives are
associated with dedicated rooms.
