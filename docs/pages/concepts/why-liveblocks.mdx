At Liveblocks, we firmly believe that flexible office policies are here to stay,
and that as a result, all SaaS products will eventually need realtime
collaboration. Every project we undertake at Liveblocks stems from this belief,
and the belief that we can empower people to work better together, and feel more
closely connected with one another.

## Why collaboration

In 2006, following years of development, Google launched their browser-based
realtime collaborative Microsoft Word competitor. This approach transformed the
way people work together enabling them to collaborate efficiently in realtime
but also asynchronously via comments—no more disjointed email threads with files
being passed around. As Google were gaining market shares, Microsoft were forced
to build similar collaboration features directly into Microsoft Word and the
broader Microsoft Office ecosystem in order to compete.

Around a decade later, Figma flipped the whole software design industry on its
head with their browser-based tool for multiplayer design, and subsequently left
leading companies behind. Few designers believed a quality design tool could be
built into the browser, and no designers wanted to have their peers and managers
looking over their shoulders while designing. Yet, the Figma team proved
everybody wrong and a majority of designers started to use their product. And
because Figma was built with collaboration at its core, engineers, product
managers, executives, marketers, and copywriters quickly followed.

Those companies had the technical expertise, along with millions of dollars, to
pull this off. A handful of forward-looking companies were also able to build
incredible collaborative products and became leaders in their respective
markets: Notion, Pitch, Canva, Miro, Mural, Linear, to mention a few. While more
and more companies are becoming aware of the importance of collaboration, only
the ones that have gone through this process truly understand how painful and
expensive it is to build and maintain.
