Use the storage conflict‑free data types to enable people to edit the same
document in real‑time.

<Banner title="Storage persistence">
  
Storage data automatically persists when people leave the room. The data
can also be cleared and stored on your database using the{" "}
[REST API endpoints](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-rooms-roomId-storage).

## Conflict-free data types

### LiveObject

The `LiveObject` data type is similar to a JavaScript object that is
synchronized on all clients. Keys should be strings, and values should be
serializable to JSON. If multiple clients update the same property
simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks servers is the
winner.

### LiveMap

The `LiveMap` class is similar to a JavaScript Map that is synchronized on all
clients. Use this for indexing values that all have the same structure. Keys
should be strings, and values should be serializable to JSON. If multiple
clients update the same property simultaneously, the last modification received
by the Liveblocks servers is the winner.

### LiveList

The `LiveList` class represents an ordered collection of items that is
synchorinized across clients. Items should be serializable to JSON or another
Live data type.

## Validating storage modifications on the server

If you want to ensure all incoming storage modifications are valid, you can
attach a storage schema to your rooms. The server will use that to automatically
reject invalid modifications. You can learn more about schema validation
[here](/docs/platform/schema-validation).
