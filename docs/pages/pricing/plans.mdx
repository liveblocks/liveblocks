Liveblocks offers three plans: Free, Pro, and Enterprise. Each plan is designed
to meet the needs of different types of developers, from personal projects to
large enterprises.

## Free

The Free plan is ideal for personal projects, prototyping, and testing. It
includes access to Liveblocks’ collaboration infrastructure, ready-made features
(Comments, Multiplayer, AI Agents, Notifications), and pre-built components,
with up to <Limits.FreeMaxMonthlyActiveRooms /> monthly active rooms included.
When you exceed your free limits, users won’t be able to join rooms.

"Powered by Liveblocks" badge, and allows you to go beyond the

## General billing information

### Where do I understand my usage?

You can monitor usage for your projects on the [usage page](/dashboard/usage) of
your dashboard.

### What happens when I reach 100% usage?

All plans receive notifications by email when they are approaching and exceed
their [usage limits](/docs/platform/limits).

Free plans will be paused when they exceed the included free tier usage.

For Pro and Enterprise plans, when you reach 100% usage your projects are not
automatically stopped. Rather, Liveblocks enables you to incur on-demand usage
as your application grows. It’s important to be aware of
[the usage page](/dashboard/usage) of your dashboard to see if you are
approaching your limit.

## Powered by Liveblocks branding

By default, Liveblocks displays a "Powered by Liveblocks" badge in your
application. You can adjust the position of the badge by setting the
`badgeLocation` property on
[`LiveblocksProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProvider).

```tsx title="Set badge location"
// "top-right", "bottom-right", "bottom-left", "top-left"
<LiveblocksProvider badgeLocation="bottom-right">
  <App />
</LiveblocksProvider>
```

If you wish to remove remove the badge entirely, you can do so by following
these steps:

1. In the Liveblocks dashboard, navigate to your
   [team’s settings](/dashboard/settings).
2. Under **General**, toggle on the remove "Powered by Liveblocks" branding
   option.
