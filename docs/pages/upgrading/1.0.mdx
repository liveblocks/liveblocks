Liveblocks 1.0 is our first major release, marking the end of the beta period
for storage and conflict-free data types. This release includes improvements to
our pricing model that make billing more predictable. Additionally, we have
vastly improved the ability to animate cursors at up to 60fps by updating the
throttle option in `createClient`. The primary change you should note is the
transition to making the `userId` mandatory in the `authorize` option. This
change is in line with our [new pricing model](https://liveblocks.io/pricing).

Let’s take a look!

## Upgrading steps by package

### @liveblocks/node [#node]

To update `@liveblocks/node` to 1.0, run the following command using your
preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/node@1.0.0
```

#### Update the authorize option [@hidden]

We have updated the `authorize` method to make `userId` mandatory. This change
ties into our new [pricing model](https://liveblocks.io/pricing), which is based
on Monthly Active Users (MAU) instead of connections. We use `userId` to track
MAU associated with a Liveblocks account.

```ts highlight="20"
import { authorize } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Replace this key with your secret key provided at
// https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/projects/{projectId}/apikeys
const secret = "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

export default async function auth(req, res) {
  /**
   * Implement your own security here.
   *
   * It’s your responsibility to ensure that the caller of this endpoint
   * is a valid user by validating the cookies or authentication headers
   * and that it has access to the requested room.
   */
  const room = req.body.room;
  const response = await authorize({
    room,
    secret,
    // Corresponds to the UserMeta[id] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
    userId: "123", // Required
    groupIds: ["456"], // Optional
    userInfo: {
      // Optional, corresponds to the UserMeta[info] type defined in liveblocks.config.ts
      name: "Ada Lovelace",
      color: "red",
    },
  });
  return res.status(response.status).end(response.body);
}
```

If you do not use the `authorize` function because you are using the public API
key method, a cookie will be set in the browser when a user connects to a room.
This cookie will be used to track MAU associated with a Liveblocks account and
will expire after 30 days.

### Authorize endpoint [#authorize-endpoint]

If you do not use the `authorize` function, but call the `authorize` endpoint
with a secret key instead, you should pass the `userId` even though it is not
mandatory on the API level because the userID will be used for MAU. Set the
`Authorization: Bearer` header to your secret key.

```ts
POST https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/{roomId}/authorize
```

Set the following the request body:

```ts highlight="3"
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "groupIds": [
    "g1",
    "g2"
  ],
  "userInfo": {
    "name": "bob",
    "colors": [
      "blue",
      "red"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Improvements [#improvements]

We added additional features to [Webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks),
enhancements to the `Room` class, and more. You can review the
[release notes](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/releases) for more
details.

### @liveblocks/client [#client-improvements]

To update `@liveblocks/client` to 1.0, run the following command using your
preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@1.0.0
```

#### Improvements to throttle allow animation of up to 60fps [@hidden]

You can now specify the `throttle` option in
[`createClient`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientThrottle)
that can go as low as 16ms. If not set, the default value is 100ms.

```ts highlight="5"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  /* ... other options ... */
  throttle: 16,
});
```

You can see the marked improvement in the animation from 80ms (original limit)
to 16ms in this
[tweet](https://twitter.com/ctnicholasdev/status/1622656511758700546). If you
want to try it out for yourself, check out
[live cursors example](https://liveblocks.io/examples/live-cursors/nextjs).

#### New methods available on the Room class [@hidden]

We added new methods to the `Room` class that you can use to obtain the storage
status of a room, subscribe to storage status changes, or reconnect to a room
whenever necessary. You can also use the
[Liveblocks DevTools extension](/devtools) to visualize realtime changes to
storage while implementing these changes.

Use `room.getStorageStatus` to retrieve the storage status of a room. The
statuses are:

- `not-loaded`: Initial state when entering the room.
- `loading`: Once the storage has been requested via room.getStorage().
- `synchronizing`: When some local updates have not been acknowledged by
  Liveblocks servers.
- `synchronized`: Storage is in sync with Liveblocks servers.

Use `room.subscribe` to subscribe to storage status changes. This method returns
an unsubscribe function.

```ts
room.subscribe("storage-status", (status) => {
  // Implement your logic here
  switch (status) {
    case "not-loaded":
      break;
    case "loading":
      break;
    case "synchronizing":
      break;
    case "synchronized":
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
});
```

You can use `room.reconnect()` to close the room connection and try to
[reconnect](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Room.reconnect).

### @liveblocks/node [#node-improvements]

#### Webhooks enhancements [@hidden]

We have added two new events to our Webhooks functionality: `RoomCreatedEvent`
and `RoomDeletedEvent`. We have also added a `WebhookHandler` class to make it
easier to verify event requests from Liveblocks’ Webhooks functionality. It also
provides fully typed `WebhookEvents`.

```ts
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(process.env.SECRET);

const event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
  headers: req.headers,
  rawBody: req.body,
});
```

Verification of events is critical to ensure that the events are coming from
Liveblocks and not from a malicious source. Check out our
[Webhooks guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/webhooks) for more details.

That’s it!
