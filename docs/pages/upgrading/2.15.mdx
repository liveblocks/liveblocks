This version of Liveblocks drops support for React versions below 18.

## Does this affect you? [#does-this-affect-you]

If you are **already on React 18 or above**, you do not have to do anything.
Just enjoy the smaller bundle size and performance improvements!

If **you are on React 16 or 17**, you should upgrade React before upgrading
Liveblocks to 2.15. See the [instructions below](#how-to-upgrade).

If **you cannot upgrade to React 18 yet** for whatever reason, you can still
keep using Liveblocks 2.14 which is the last version to support React 17 and
below.

## How to upgrade? [#how-to-upgrade]

To upgrade Liveblocks to 2.15, first upgrade React to 18 by following the
[How to Upgrade to React 18](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide).

Then, upgrade all Liveblocks packages by running:

```bash
npx liveblocks@latest upgrade
```

You can now safely remove this line from your codebase:

```diff
-import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from "react-dom";
 //                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^ ...or "react-native"!

 <RoomProvider
   id="my-room"
   initialPresence={/* ... */}
   initialStorage={/* ... */}
-  unstable_batchedUpdates={unstable_batchedUpdates}
 >
   <App />
 </RoomProvider>
```

That’s it!
