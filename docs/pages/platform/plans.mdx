Liveblocks offers two plans: Pro, and Enterprise. The Pro plans comes with a
free sandbox environment, allowing you to prototype with Liveblocks before
putting it into production. The Enterprise plan offers higher limits, enhanced
features, and resources. Both plans include our
[first day free policy](#first-day-free-policy), meaning you only pay for
returning users.

## Pro plan

The Pro plan is designed for companies putting AI and collaboration into
production. It allows you to purchase each of our ready-made features
separately, meaning you only pay for what you use. Start with a single product
and scale up as you need.

- [AI Copilots](/docs/ready-made-features/ai-copilots): Easily embed advanced AI
  chats and copilots into your product.
- [Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments): Integrate pre-built commenting
  into your app, enhancing collaboration.
- [Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications): Add an inbox into
  your app, updating users about unread comments and more.
- [Multiplayer Editing](/docs/ready-made-features/multiplayer-editing): Let
  users collaborate in realtime within text editors, custom apps, and more.
- [Presence](/docs/ready-made-features/presence): Create live presence
  indicators such as cursors and avatar stacks.

Typical range is around **$180–$1,680 per month** depending on usage and
features activated. The Pro plan comes with:

- Pre-built components
- Realtime infrastructure
- SOC 2 Type 2
- Multi-factor auth
