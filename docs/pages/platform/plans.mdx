Liveblocks offers two plans: Pro, and Enterprise. The Pro plans comes with a
free sandbox environment, allowing you to prototype with Liveblocks before
putting it into production. The Enterprise plan offers higher limits, enhanced
features, and resources. Both plans include our
[first day free policy](#first-day-free-policy), meaning you only pay for
returning users.

companies adding collaboration in production. Key features include:

## General billing information

### What is a monthly active user (MAU)?

Monthly active users (MAU) represents the number of users that have used any
Liveblocks features within a given month, with the exception of users that only
connect one time, as they are [always free](#first-day-free-policy). Users are
identified by the `userId` property provided in your
[authentication endpoint](/docs/authentication). This `userId` generally comes
from your database or your authentication provider.

One unique `userId` corresponds to one user, no matter how long they connect
for. For example, a user that connects for 5 minutes on 2 different days is
counted as 1 MAU, and a user that connects 8 hours a day for a month is also
counted as 1 MAU. This applies so long as usage falls under our
[Fair Use Policy](/docs/platform/limits/fair-use-policy).

### First day free policy [#first-day-free-policy]

All plans include our first day free policy, meaning you only pay for returning
users. In concrete terms, when a `userId` connects for the first time, they do
not count towards your MAU limit. They are only counted when they connect to
Liveblocks _again_ on another calendar day. For all users, days start at 00:00
UTC and end at 23:59:59 UTC.

### How is data storage calculated?

Storage for Text Editor and Sync Datastore is a cumulative calculation that
represents all data that is currently stored. It does not reset monthly, and the
total usage will continue to accrue over time as you add more content and data.
You can monitor your usage at any time in the [dashboard](/dashboard).

### What’s a room?

A room is the virtual space where people collaborate. For most products, a room
corresponds to a document.

### What’s a connection?

A connection occurs when a user opens a web page containing a Liveblocks room.
Each tab counts as one connection, which means that a user with two open tabs
has two connections. A room is joined when using{" "}
[`RoomProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RoomProvider) in React or
[`enterRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.enterRoom) in
JavaScript. Liveblocks connections are analogous to WebSocket connections,
representing a realtime link to our server.

### What’s a simultaneous connection per room?

A simultaneous connection per room is when a user or multiple users are
connected to the same Liveblocks room at the same time.

### What’s a simultaneous connection per project?

A simultaneous connection per project is when a user or multiple users are
connected to the same project at the same time.

### What happens when limits are reached?

Liveblocks returns a different error for each limit that a user might reach.
That way, you can decide how to best handle those cases in your product.
[Learn more about limits](/docs/platform/limits).

### Do you count monthly active users during testing?

If you connect to rooms and call the Liveblocks API during any automated
testing, you may want to provide a static `userId` to avoid hitting limits.

For example, you could do this by setting an environment variable and checking
the process when you call `authorize` from `@liveblocks/node`.

```dotenv file=".env.test"
 TEST_USERID="machine"
```

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
export default async function auth(req, res) {
  const room = req.body.room;
  const response = await authorize({
    room,
    secret,
    userId:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === "test" ? process.env.TEST_USERID : "user123",
  });
  return res.status(response.status).end(response.body);
}
```
