Liveblocks offers three plans: Free, Pro, and Enterprise. Each plan is designed
to meet the needs of different types of developers, from personal projects to
large enterprises.

## Free

The Free plan is ideal for personal projects, prototyping, and testing. It
includes access to Liveblocks’ collaboration infrastructure, ready-made features
(Comments, Multiplayer, AI Agents, Notifications), and pre-built components,
with up to <Limits.FreeMaxMonthlyActiveRooms /> monthly active rooms included.
Projects on the Free plan show a small “Powered by Liveblocks” badge. When you
exceed your free limits, users won’t be able to join rooms.

## Pro

The Pro plan is designed for teams shipping a collaborative experiences in
production with the ability to scale. It includes everything in Free, but
enables you to remove the “Powered by Liveblocks” badge, and allows you to go
beyond the
included{/* prettier-ignore */} <Limits.ProMonthlyActiveRoomsIncluded /> monthly active rooms via pay-as-you-go overage, and unlocks access to enterprise add-ons.

## Enterprise

The Enterprise plan is tailored for organizations with advanced security,
compliance, and scalability requirements. It includes everything in Pro, plus
multi-region hosting, a management API, SCIM/directory sync, advanced
permissions, custom usage allocations, and higher-touch support options such as
SLAs and solution engineering.

## General billing information

### Where do I understand my usage?

You can monitor usage for your projects on the [usage page](/dashboard/usage) of
your dashboard.

### What happens when I reach 100% usage?

All plans receive notifications by email when they are approaching and exceed
their [usage limits](/docs/platform/limits).

Free plans will be paused when they exceed the included free tier usage.

For Pro and Enterprise plans, when you reach 100% usage your projects are not
automatically stopped. Rather, Liveblocks enables you to incur on-demand usage
as your application grows. It’s important to be aware of
[the usage page](/dashboard/usage) of your dashboard to see if you are
approaching your limit.
