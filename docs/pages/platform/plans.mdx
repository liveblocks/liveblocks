## General billing information

### What is a monthly active user?

A monthly active user is an identified or anonymous user who connects to a
Liveblocks room at lease once a month.

If you use the public API key to create the Liveblocks client, all users will be
anonymous. A cookie will be automatically set on the browser for 30 days to
avoid counting the same user multiple times.

If you use a backend endpoint with the secret API key to create the Liveblocks
client, all users will be identified through the `userId` property. We recommend
using this method for counting accuracy. See the
[authentication](/docs/rooms/authentication) docs for more information.

One user will be counted as one monthly active user, no matter how frequently
they connect to Liveblocks rooms in any given month as long as it falls under
our [Fair Use Policy](/docs/platform/limits/fair-use-policy).

Users coming from `localhost`, `.local`, `.localhost`, and `.test` domains are
not counted towards your billing.

  You must use the 1.0 or newer Liveblocks packages to have monthly active users
  counted appropriately. We will count each connection as one MAU if you do not
  update your packages to 1.0. See the [upgrade
  guide](/docs/platform/upgrading/1.0) for more information.

### Do you count monthly active users during testing?

If you connect to rooms and call the Liveblocks API during any automated
testing, you may want to provide a static `userId` to avoid hitting limits.

For example, you could do this by setting an environment variable and checking
the process when you call `authorize` from `@liveblocks/node`.

```dotenv file=".env.test"
 TEST_USERID="machine"
```

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
export default async function auth(req, res) {
  const room = req.body.room;
  const response = await authorize({
    room,
    secret,
    userId:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === "test" ? process.env.TEST_USERID : "user123",
  });
  return res.status(response.status).end(response.body);
}
```
