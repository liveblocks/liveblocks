## General billing information

### What is a monthly active user (MAU)?

Monthly active users (MAU) is the number of users who have at least used one
Liveblocks feature within a given month.

Users are identified by the `userId` property provided in your
[authentication endpoint](/docs/authentication).

This `userId` generally comes from your database or your authentication
provider. One unique `userId` corresponds to one user, whether they connected to
a room 1 day for 5 minutes or kept coming back every day for 8 hours.

One user will be counted as one monthly active user, no matter how frequently
they connect to Liveblocks rooms in any given month as long as it falls under
our [Fair Use Policy](/docs/platform/limits/fair-use-policy).

<Banner>
  You must use the 1.0 or newer Liveblocks packages to have monthly active users
  counted appropriately. We will count each connection as one MAU if you do not
  update your packages to 1.0. See the [upgrade
  guide](/docs/platform/upgrading/1.0) for more information.

### How is data storage calculated?

Storage for Text Editor and Sync Datastore is a cumulative calculation that
represents all data that is currently stored. It does not reset monthly, and the
total usage will continue to accrue over time as you add more content and data.
You can monitor your usage at any time in the [dashboard](/dashboard).

### Do you count monthly active users during testing?

If you connect to rooms and call the Liveblocks API during any automated
testing, you may want to provide a static `userId` to avoid hitting limits.

For example, you could do this by setting an environment variable and checking
the process when you call `authorize` from `@liveblocks/node`.

```dotenv file=".env.test"
 TEST_USERID="machine"
```

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
export default async function auth(req, res) {
  const room = req.body.room;
  const response = await authorize({
    room,
    secret,
    userId:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === "test" ? process.env.TEST_USERID : "user123",
  });
  return res.status(response.status).end(response.body);
}
```
