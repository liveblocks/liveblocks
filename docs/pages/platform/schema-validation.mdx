## Why schema validation?

Schema validation is essential for future-proofing your application and ensuring
that implementing new features or data structures into your app will keep the
integration you have established with Liveblocks.

We currently mitigate the risk of introducing client-side errors by allowing you
to type your storage in `liveblocks.config.ts`. Still, we want to go one step
further to help you protect your application by attaching a schema to a room
that rejects invalid modifications.

By using schema validation, you will be able to:

- Trust any incoming storage modifications
- Paired with webhooks, strengthen your database synchronization
- Write migration scripts for your room storage more easily

## How schema validation works

The primary purpose of schema validation is to prevent corrupted data from being
loaded from the server. To add schema validation to your application, take the
following steps:

1. Define the shape of your storage with a schema definition (similar to how you
   would describe the storage type in TypeScript)
2. Attach your schema to a room

By default, a room storage accepts any modifications coming from the client. But
once you attach a schema to a room, Liveblocks will reject any modifications to
the storage that do not match the schema you provided. Situations like this
should only happen in development mode, and the developer is responsible for
fixing them.

## Schema actions

You can interact with the schemas you create through the dashboard or by calling
the [REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints). In this guide, we will
cover the following operations:

- [Creating a schema](#creating-a-schema)
- [Deleting a schema](#deleting-a-schema)
- [Attaching a schema to a room](#attaching-a-schema-to-a-room)
- [Detaching a schema from a room](#detaching-a-schema-from-a-room)

You can also use the REST API to
[list schemas](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#list-schemas),
[get a schema](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-schema), and
[update a schema](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#update-schema).

### Creating a schema

Creating a schema via the dashboard is straightforward. Simply navigate to the
“Schemas” page in the project you want to add the schema, and click on the
“Create schema” button. Provide a name and a definition that describes the shape
of the data you want to store in your rooms.

      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>

Another way to create a schema is via the
[create schema API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-create-new-schema).
A schema body is a multi-line string using the Liveblocks
[schema syntax](/docs/platform/schema-validation/syntax). In the dashboard, a
sample schema could be represented as:

```ts
type Storage {
  todos: LiveList<LiveObject<Todo>>
}

type Todo {
  text: string
  checked?: boolean
}
```

To create a schema, provide the name and body in the JSON payload. Example:

```ts
fetch("https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/schemas", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "todo-list",
    body: `
      type Storage {
        todos: LiveList<LiveObject<Todo>>
      }

      type Todo {
        text: string
        checked?: boolean
      }
    `,
  }),
});
```

Note that in this example, the outermost `body` field is the body of the HTTP
request (required by the `fetch` API), whereas the innermost `body` field is
consumed by our API to read the schema text.

### Deleting a schema

In the dashboard, you can delete a schema by navigating to the schema in
question and clicking on the trash icon next to the schema version you want to
delete. If you have attached a schema to a room, you will need to detach the
schema from the room before you can delete it. If this schema is frozen, the
trash icon will be greyed out.

      src="/assets/schema-validation/delete-schema.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>

If your schema is in a detached state, you can also delete it by using the
[delete schema API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-a-schema).

```ts
fetch("https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/schemas/{id}", {
  method: "DELETE",
});
```

### Attaching a schema to a room

You can attach a schema to a room via the dashboard by navigating to the room in
question and clicking on the “Attach schema” button.

      src="/assets/schema-validation/attach-schema.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>

Alternatively, you can use the
[attach schema API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-attach-schema-to-room).
For example:

```ts
fetch("https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/{roomId}/schema", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    schema: "todo-list@1",
  }),
});
```

To attach a schema to a room, you must first create a room and initialize storage.

### Detaching a schema from a room

You can use the dashboard to remove a schema from a room by navigating to the
room in question and clicking on the dropdown menu which displays the currently
attached schema. From there, you can click on the “Detach schema” button.

<Figure>

    <source
      src="/assets/schema-validation/detach-schema.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>

To detach a schema from a room using the
[detach schema API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-detach-schema-to-room),
use the following code:

```ts
fetch("https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/{roomId}/schema", {
  method: "DELETE",
});
```

## The validation process in practice

If you would like to work through an example, you can follow along by using the
[Collaborative To-Do List](/examples/collaborative-todo-list/react).

Let’s create a new schema called `todo-list` in your dashboard, with the
following definition:

```ts
type Storage {
  todos: LiveList<LiveObject<Todo>>
}

type Todo {
  text: string
  checked?: boolean
}
```

Schemas are automatically versioned to facilitate migrations. By saving the new
schema, we have created the first version, named `todo-list@1`.

To attach the schema we just created to a room, you can:

- Navigate to the "next-js-todo-list-v2" room and click on "Attach Schema", as
  shown in the video above
- Call the following endpoint:

```ts
POST https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/nextjs-todo-list-v2/schema
{
  "schema": "todo-list@1"
}
```

To demonstrate the importance of schema validation and how unsafe operations
will now fail, we will change the `checked` field in our schema as required,
which means that new items added to the list will have to be checked by default.

The new schema definition will look like this:

```ts
type Storage {
  todos: LiveList<LiveObject<Todo>>
}

type Todo {
  text: string
  checked: boolean
}
```

After updating the schema, and attaching the new version to our room, we can now
run our app locally by calling `npm run dev` and adding a new item to the list.
The new item will cause the following error to be thrown:

```
Error: Storage mutations rejected by server: Missing required property 'checked' on type 'LiveList<LiveObject<Todo>>'.
```

<Figure>
  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source
      src="/assets/schema-validation/reject-schema.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />
  </video>
</Figure>

Other examples where schema validation would catch the error include:

- Attempting to update the value of the `checked` variable to a number, as it is
  defined as a boolean in the schema
- Attempting to delete the `checked` variable: it was not defined as optional in
  the schema

## How to handle validation errors

When a schema validation error occurs, the LiveBlocks server will reject the
operation

When an instance like this occurs, it’s indicative of a bug in your app. In
production, an error like this should never occur. This is because you should
address validation errors in the same way you address TypeScript errors. You
don't ship to production when your app has TypeScript errors, and neither do you
ship to prod when there are schema validation errors. Validation errors are the
responsibility of the developer to resolve.

## What’s to come

Our roadmap includes the ability to generate TypeScript types from the schema
and tools to help you migrate your data from one schema version to the next. If
you have any feedback or questions regarding schema validation, come talk to us
