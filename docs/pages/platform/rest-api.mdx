Liveblocks REST API allows developers to interact programmatically with their
Liveblocks account and services using HTTP requests. With the API, developers
can retrieve, set, and update room-related data, users, permissions, schemas,
and more.

The Liveblocks API is organized around REST. The API has predictable
resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns
JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication,
and verbs. See the [API reference](api-reference/rest-api-endpoints) for more
information.
