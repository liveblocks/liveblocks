_Directory sync_ helps teams manage their organization membership from a
third-party identity provider like Google Directory or Okta. To use directory
sync,
[SSO must be configured\***\* \*\***first](/docs/platform/account-management/saml)
as it requires an active SSO connection.

## How it works

When directory sync is configured, changes to your directory provider will
automatically be synced with your team members. The previously existing
permissions/roles will be overwritten by directory sync, including current user
performing the sync.

Make sure you’re a member of the groups from the directory provider that you’re
syncing with Liveblocks. Otherwise, you may lock yourself out.

You can configure a mapping between your directory provider’s groups and a
Liveblocks team role. For example, your _engineers_ group on Okta can be
configured with the _member_ role on Liveblocks, and your _admin_ group can use
the _owner_ role.
