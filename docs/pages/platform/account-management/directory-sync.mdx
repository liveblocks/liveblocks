_Directory sync_ helps teams manage their organization membership from a
third-party identity provider like Google Directory or Okta. To use directory
sync, [SSO must be configured first](/docs/platform/account-management/saml) as
it requires an active SSO connection.

## How it works

When directory sync is configured, changes to your directory provider will
automatically be synced with your team members. The previously existing
permissions/roles will be overwritten by directory sync, including current user
performing the sync.

Make sure you’re a member of the groups from the directory provider that you’re
syncing with Liveblocks. Otherwise, you may lock yourself out.

You can configure a mapping between your directory provider’s groups and a
Liveblocks team role. For example, your _engineers_ group on Okta can be
configured with the _member_ role on Liveblocks, and your _admin_ group can use
the _owner_ role.

### Configuring directory sync

1. To configure directory sync for your team, you must be an owner of the team
   (see
   [how to manage team members](/docs/platform/account-management/manage-team-members)).
2. From your dashboard, ensure your team is selected in the scope selector.
3. Navigate to the “Settings” tab and select “Security & Privacy”.
4. Navigate to the “Directory sync” section.
5. Click “Configure” and follow the walkthrough to configure directory sync for
   your team with your directory provider of choice.
6. Map your directory groups to appropriate Liveblocks team roles.
