Directory Sync helps teams manage their organization membership from a
third-party identity provider like Google Directory or Okta.

SSO must be configured fist - Directory Sync requires an active SSO connection.

When Directory Sync is configured, changes to your Directory Provider will
automatically be synced with your team members. The previously existing
permissions/roles will be overwritten by Directory Sync, including current user
performing the sync.

  Make sure that you still have the right permissions/role after configuring
  Directory Sync, otherwise you might lock yourself out.

You can configure a mapping between your Directory Provider's groups and a
Liveblocks Team role. For example, your Engineers group on Okta can be
configured with the member role on Liveblocks, and your Admin group can use the
owner role.
