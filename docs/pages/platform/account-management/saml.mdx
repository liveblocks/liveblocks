SSO enables teams to enforce authentication via identity providers like Okta,
Azure AD, Google Workspace, or OneLogin using SAML. This simplifies account
management, and helps organizations meet internal security requirements. Paired
with Directory Sync, teams can manage organization membership directly from
their identity provider, reducing manual overhead and aligning with standard
enterprise access control practices.

Once enabled, all team members will be able to log in to the dashboard using
your selected identity provider. You’ll still need to invite users to your team
for them to have access. If you would like all users signing up with SSO to be
automatically added to your team, please contact us.

You can also use
[Directory Sync](/docs/platform/account-management/directory-sync) to
automatically assign users to your team with a specific role.

## Configuring SSO

After SSO is enabled on your account, you can configure it for your team.

1. To configure SSO, you must be an owner of the team (see
   [how to manage team members](/docs/platform/account-management/manage-team-members)).
2. From your dashboard, ensure your team is selected in the scope selector.
3. Navigate to the “Settings” tab and select “Security & Privacy”.
4. Navigate to the “SSO” section.
5. Click “Configure” and follow the walkthrough to configure SSO for your team
   with the identity provider of your choice.

## Enforcing SSO

For additional security, SSO can be enforced for a team so that all team members
cannot access any team information unless their current session is authenticated
with SSO. If you want to activate this setting, please contact us at
[support@liveblocks.io](mailto:support@liveblocks.io).

### Automatic provisioning

By default, you still need to manually invite users to your team for them to
have access to it. If you would like all users signing up with SSO to be
automatically added to your team, please contact us at
[support@liveblocks.io](mailto:support@liveblocks.io).

## Authenticating with SSO

Once you have configured SSO, your team members can use it to log in or sign up
to Liveblocks. They only have to enter their email, and they will be redirected
to the third-party authentication provider that you configured.
