Once enabled, all team members will be able to log in to the dashboard using
your selected identity provider. You will still need to invite users to your
team for them to have access. If you would like all users signing up with SSO to
be automatically added to your team, please contact us.

You can also use
[Directory Sync](/docs/platform/account-management/directory-sync) to
automatically assign users to your team with a specific role.

### Enforcing SSO

For additional security, SSO can be enforced for a team so that all team members
cannot access any team information unless their current session was
authenticated with SSO.

If you want to activate this setting, please contact us.

### Automatic members provisioning

By default, you still need to manually invite users to your team for them to
have access to it. If you would like all users signing up with SSO to be
automatically added to your team, please contact us.

### Authenticating with SSO

Once you have configured SSO, your team members can use it to log in or sign up
to Liveblocks. They only have to enter their email, and they will be redirected
to the third-party authentication provider that you configured.
