_Multi-factor authentication_ (MFA) adds an additional layer of security by
requiring a code from an authenticator app when signing in. Liveblocks offers
two ways to use MFA:

- **User-level enrollment**: Individual users voluntarily enable MFA for their
  own account.
- **Enterprise enforcement**: Team owners require all team members to have MFA
  enabled. Only for enterprise customers, does not apply to Single Sign-On
  members.

## Enroll MFA for your account

Any user can enable MFA on their personal account for extra security. This is
optional and applies only to your own sign-in.

### How to enroll MFA for your account

1. Go to
   [**Personal settings**](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/personal-settings) in
   the dashboard.
2. In the **Two-factor authentication** section, click **Enable**.

3. In the setup modal, scan the QR code with your authenticator app, or copy the
   setup key and paste it into your app.
4. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app and click **Confirm**.

### How to disable MFA for your account

1. Go to
   [**Personal settings**](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/personal-settings) in
   the dashboard.
2. In the **Two-factor authentication** section, click **Disable**.
3. Enter your password and click **Confirm**.

An alert will be prompted to confirm the action. In our current set up if you
are a member of an enterprise team enforcing MFA for all its members, next time
you sign in you will be prompted to enroll MFA again.

When MFA is enforced at the team level, all members must have an authenticator
app. They are prompted to enter a code when signing in to the dashboard.

[sales@liveblocks.io](mailto:sales@liveblocks.io) to enable it on your account.
After it’s enabled, it works without configuration.
