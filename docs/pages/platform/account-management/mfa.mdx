_Multi-factor authentication_ (MFA) adds an additional layer of security to
teams to manage their members by enforcing them to have an authenticator app.
Does not apply to Single Sign-On members.

## How it works

When MFA is enabled, all team members will be required to have an authenticator
app installed on their device. They will be prompted to enter a code from the
app when they log in to the dashboard.
