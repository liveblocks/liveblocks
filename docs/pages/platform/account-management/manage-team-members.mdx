Teams are made up of members, and each member can be assigned a role. These
roles define what you can and cannot do within a team on Liveblocks.

As your project scales and you add more team members, you can assign them roles
to ensure that they have the right permissions to work on your projects.

## Inviting team members

To invite new members to your team, select the team from the scope selector,
then open the **Settings\* tab and select the **Members\*\* section.

Enter the email address of the person you would like to invite, select their
role, and hit the **Invite** button.

## Access roles

Liveblocks offers two types of roles for team members, each providing different
levels of access and permissions.

### Owner role

As a team owner, you have full administrative control over your team. This
includes the ability to manage all aspects of account and project settings,
security, and billing.

Team owners can manage API keys in all projects and also change the roles of
other team members â€” including promoting members to owners. However, the only
way an owner can renounce their role is by either choosing to leave or deleting
the team altogether.

Teams can have more than one owner. For continuity, we recommend that at least
two individuals have owner permissions. Additional owners can be added without
any impact on existing ownership. Keep in mind that role changes, including
assignment and revocation of team member roles, are an exclusive capability of
those with the owner role.

### Member role

Those with the member role have the ability to create and manage projects. They
are also granted permissions to manage API keys for all projects.

However, there are certain team-level settings that are off-limits to members.
These include editing team settings like billing information and the ability to
invite new users to the team. This restriction is in place to maintain the
division of responsibilities and control between members and owners.
