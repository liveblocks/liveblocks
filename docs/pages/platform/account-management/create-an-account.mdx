When you create a new account with Liveblocks, youâ€™re automatically creating a
team account on a Starter plan. This plan is free to use (subject to the
[Fair Use Policy](limits/fair-use-policy)) forever. You cannot invite others to
collaborate on your Liveblocks team account unless you upgrade to a paid plan.

To create a new account, visit [liveblocks.io/signup](/api/auth/signup). You can
choose to sign up with your email address, or with a GitHub or Google provider.

### Sign up with email

If you choose to sign up with your email address, you will be asked to enter
your email address. You will then be asked to verify your email address by
clicking a link in an email Liveblocks sends you.

When signing up with your email, you will be asked to verify your account on
every login attempt while logging in with your email.

### Sign up with a provider

If you choose to sign up with Google or GitHub provider, you will be asked to
authorize Liveblocks to access your provider account. This connection will then
become the default login connection on your account.
