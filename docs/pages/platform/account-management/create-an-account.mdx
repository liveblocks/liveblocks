When you create a new account with Liveblocks, you’re automatically creating a
team account on a Starter plan. This plan is free to use (subject to the
[Fair Use Policy](/docs/platform/limits/fair-use-policy)) forever. You cannot
invite others to collaborate on your Liveblocks team account until you upgrade
to a paid plan.

To create a new account, visit [liveblocks.io/signup](/api/auth/signup). You can
choose to sign up with your email address, or with a GitHub or Google provider.

### Sign up with email

If you choose to sign up with your email address, you’ll be prompted to enter it
in a form. After signing up, you can then verify your new account by clicking a
link in an email Liveblocks sends you. In future, when signing in with your
email, you’ll be asked to verify your account every time you log in.

### Sign up with a provider

If you choose to sign up with Google or GitHub provider, you will be asked to
authorize Liveblocks to access your provider account. This connection will then
become the default login connection on your account.
