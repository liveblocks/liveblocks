All Liveblocks subscription plans are subject to this Fair Use Policy.

## Usage guidelines

We have established guidelines for our communityâ€™s usage of our plans. Most
users should fall within the specified ranges, however, if usage is excessive,
we will notify you and work to address the issue. Our aim is to be accommodating
while maintaining the stability of our infrastructure.

a look at the [plans](/docs/platform/plans) docs.

### Other guidelines

The `userId` must be used to represent a single user.

### Commercial usage

**Starter accounts** are restricted to non-commercial use only. All commercial
usage of the platform requires either a Pro or Enterprise plan.

Commercial usage refers to any usage of the Liveblocks platform in projects
where financial gain is being sought by any party involved in the production,
including paid employees or consultants.
