All Liveblocks subscription plans are subject to this Fair Use Policy.

## Usage guidelines

We have established guidelines for our community’s usage of our plans. Most
users should fall within the specified ranges, however, if usage is excessive,
we will notify you and work to address the issue. Our aim is to be accommodating
while maintaining the stability of our infrastructure.

### Typical usage guidelines

To learn more about how monthly active users are calculated for each plan, take
a look at the [plans](/docs/platform/plans) docs.

### Other guidelines

The `userId` must be used to represent a single user.

### Commercial usage

The Pro plan’s free sandbox is restricted to non-commercial use only. All
commercial usage of the platform requires a paid Pro or Enterprise plan.

Commercial usage refers to any usage of the Liveblocks platform in projects
where financial gain is being sought by any party involved in the production,
including paid employees or consultants.

### General limits

[Take a look at our limits guide](/docs/platform/limits) to learn more about the
limits we apply to all accounts.
