## Usage guidelines

As a guideline for our community, we expect most projects to fall within the
ranges outlined below for each plan. If your usage significantly exceeds these
guidelines, we’ll contact you to discuss your needs. We aim to accommodate
legitimate usage while ensuring our platform remains stable and performant for
all users. Before taking any action, we’ll work with you to find a solution that
meets your requirements.

### Typical monthly usage guidelines

|                                          | Free                                               | Pro                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Average monthly connections per per user | Up to <Limits.FreeAvgConnectionsPerMau />          | Up to <Limits.ProAvgConnectionsPerMau />          |
| Average monthly active hours per room    | Up to <Limits.FreeAvgActiveHoursPerRoomPerMonth /> | Up to <Limits.ProAvgActiveHoursPerRoomPerMonth /> |

For Teams on the Pro plan, you can pay for
[additional usage](/docs/platform/limits) as you go.

### Additional usage

For members of our Pro plan, we offer a pay-as-you-go model for additional
usage, giving you greater flexibility and control over your usage. The typical
monthly usage guidelines above are still applicable, while extra usage will be
automatically charged at the following rates:

### Commercial usage

The Free plan is limited to non-commercial, personal projects only. Any
commercial use of Liveblocks requires a Pro or Enterprise subscription.

We consider usage to be commercial when a project generates revenue or financial
benefit for anyone involved in its development, operation, or maintenance. This
includes projects built by paid employees, contractors, or consultants. Common
examples of commercial usage include:

- Applications that accept payments or process transactions
- Products or services offered for sale
- Projects developed or maintained for compensation
- Sites primarily focused on affiliate marketing
- Applications displaying advertisements or sponsored content

If you’re uncertain whether your project qualifies as commercial usage, please
reach out to our support team for clarification.

### General Limits

Take a look at our [Limits](/docs/platform/limits) documentation for the limits
we apply to all accounts.

Circumventing or otherwise misusing Liveblocks’ limits or usage guidelines is a
violation of our fair use guidelines. For further information regarding these
guidelines and acceptable use of our services, refer to our
