To use Liveblocks, you need to create a project, which groups your collaborative
rooms. Learn how to set up and configure projects in this guide

## Creating a project

You can create a new project from the Liveblocks dashboard by clicking on the
**Create project…** button.

The environment of a project can either be set to **Development** or
**Production** to help you map projects to your deployment model. This setting
cannot be changed later.

## Managing a project

Each Liveblocks project has a separate dashboard to monitor usage, configure
settings, manage API keys, and more.

### Project overview

The **Overview** tab provides an overview of your project usage, including daily
active users, monthly active users, connections, active rooms, and more.

### Project rooms

The **Rooms** tab provides a list of all the existing rooms for your projet.

You can learn more about any given by room by clicking on it. On the room detail
view, you’re able to view the stored document’s data, and common actions you can
take on that such as [attaching a schema](/platform/schema-validation) or
deleting the document’s data all together.

### Project API keys

The **API keys** tab enables you to manage, view, and roll your **public** and
**secret** API keys.

### Project schemas

The **Schemas** tab enables you to manage your document’s schemas. Schemas can
be attached to any room’s Storage document to validate incoming changes and
ensure data integrity and facilitate future potential data migrations for your
application. See our [schema validation](/platform/schema-validation) docs to
learn more.

### Project webhooks

The **Webhooks** tab enables you to configure your webhook endpoints to react to
Liveblocks events as they happen. See our [webhooks](/platform/webhooks) docs to
learn more.

### Project settings

The **Settings** tab enables you to rename and delete your project.
