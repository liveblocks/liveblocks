To use Liveblocks, you need to create a project, a place to group your
collaborative rooms. Learn how to set up and configure projects in this guide.

## Creating a project

You can create a new project from the [Liveblocks dashboard](/dashboard) by
clicking on the **Create project…** button.

### Project environment

A project’s environment can either be set to **Development** or **Production**,
helping you map projects to your deployment model. We recommend setting up a new
project for each different environment your collaborative application uses.

Secret [API keys](#project-api-keys) are treated slightly differently depending
on the environment:

- **Development** environments allow you to read your secret key any time after
  generation. It’s recommended to use this setting in development, preview, and
  staging environments.
- **Production** environments encrypt your secret key, meaning it can only be
  read when it’s first generated. If you forget your secret key, you must roll a
  new one. It’s recommended to use this environment in your production
  application.

A project’s environment cannot be changed later.

### Project location

When creating a new project in the dashboard, teams on the
[Enterprise plan](https://liveblocks.io/pricing) can specify which region the
project data will be stored and processed. There are three options:

1. N/A (No preference)
2. EU (AWS eu-central-1, Cloudflare EU)
3. US (AWS us-east-1, Cloudflare FedRAMP)

## Managing a project

Each Liveblocks project has a separate dashboard to monitor usage, configure
settings, manage API keys, and more.

### Project overview

The **Overview** tab displays an overview of your project usage, providing
information on active rooms, users, and connections.

### Project rooms

The **Rooms** tab displays all the rooms in your project. Use the search bar
next to the page title to find rooms. By default, rooms are sorted by the last
connection date (most recently active rooms). You can also sort them by room ID,
number of threads, document size, or creation date by clicking on the column
labels.

You can learn more about any given by room by clicking on it. On the room detail
view, you’re able to view the stored document’s data, and common actions you can
take on that such as deleting the document’s data.

### Project API keys [#project-api-keys]

The **API keys** tab enables you to manage, view, and roll your **public** and
**secret** API keys.

### Project webhooks

The **Webhooks** tab enables you to configure your webhook endpoints allowing
you to respond to Liveblocks events, such as a user entering a room, or storage
being updated. See our [webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks) docs to learn more.

### Project settings

The **Settings** tab enables you to rename your project. Team owners can also delete projects from this tab.
