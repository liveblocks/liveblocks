To use Liveblocks, you need to create a project, a place to group your
collaborative rooms. Learn how to set up and configure projects in this guide.

## Creating a project

You can create a new project from the [Liveblocks dashboard](/dashboard) by
clicking on the **Create project…** button.

A project’s environment can either be set to **Development** or **Production**,
helping you map projects to your deployment model. This setting cannot be
changed later.

We recommend setting up a new project for each different environment your
collaborative application uses.

## Managing a project

Each Liveblocks project has a separate dashboard to monitor usage, configure
settings, manage API keys, and more.

### Project overview

The **Overview** tab displays an overview of your project usage, providing
information on active rooms, users, and connections.

### Project rooms

The **Rooms** tab provides a list of all the existing rooms for your project.

    width={768}
    height={406}
  />
</Figure>

You can learn more about any given by room by clicking on it. On the room detail
view, you’re able to view the stored document’s data, and common actions you can
take on that such as [attaching a schema](/docs/platform/schema-validation) or
deleting the document’s data altogether.

### Project API keys

The **API keys** tab enables you to manage, view, and roll your **public** and
**secret** API keys.

### Project schemas

The **Schemas** tab enables you to manage your document’s schemas. Schemas can
be attached to any room’s Storage document to validate incoming changes and
ensure data integrity and facilitate future potential data migrations for your
application. See our [schema validation](/docs/platform/schema-validation) docs
to learn more.

### Project webhooks

The **Webhooks** tab enables you to configure your webhook endpoints allowing
you to respond to Liveblocks events, such as a user entering a room, or storage
being updated. See our [webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks) docs to learn more.

### Project settings

The **Settings** tab enables you to rename and delete your project.
