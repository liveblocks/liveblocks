Liveblocks is designed to support realtime collaboration and AI features with a
focus on performance, reliability, and privacy. While many aspects of data
handling are managed by the platform, enterprise customers can configure certain
behaviors related to data storage, retention, and region enforcement. This
document outlines what data Liveblocks stores, where it is stored, and how
deletion is handled.

## Data stored

In most cases, sensitive or personal information can be excluded from what's
sent to Liveblocks. Additionally, expanded storage configuration and data
control features are under active development for enterprise customers.

### AI Copilots

- **Data stored**: Prompt configuration, LLM connection parameters (including
  API keys), message history, tool results, token usage, model usage, chat
  names, and metadata. Back-end knowledge is an optional add-on that requires
  saving text and vectors to support knowledge recall.
- **Retention**: Persists until the user or client deletes a chat.

### Comments

- **Data stored**: Comment body, author ID, timestamps, mentions, tags, and
  metadata.
- **Retention**: Persists until the room or thread is explicitly deleted.
  Additionally, if all comments in a thread are removed, the thread is deleted.

### Multiplayer Editing

- **Data stored**: Collaborative state written in text editor and sync engine
  integrations. This includes Tiptap, BlockNote, Lexical, Storage (e.g.
  `LiveObject`), and Yjs (e.g. `Y.Doc`).
- **Retention**: Persists until the room is explicitly deleted. Storage (e.g.
  `LiveObject`) data can be deleted without deleting the room.

### Notifications

- **Data stored**: Notification message, delivery state, and recipient user ID.
- **Retention**: Persists until each notification is explicitly deleted.

### Presence

- **Data stored**: Room ID, user ID, and approximate geolocation (based on IP
  address). This is used to display session events in the Liveblocks Dashboard.
- **Retention**: Persists until a deletion request is submitted.

### Webhooks

- **Data stored**:
  [Webhook event data](/docs/platform/webhooks#Liveblocks-events), such as
  project ID, room ID, and the event type.
- **Retention**: Automatically deleted after 90 days.

## Storage Locations

### AWS

AWS is used to store various data with `us-east-1` being used as the default
region. Enterprise customers can choose to
[region lock data](/docs/platform/projects#Project-location) in `us-east-1` or
`eu-central-1`, per project.

#### Stored in AWS

- Room metadata (ID, accesses, metadata).
- Comments.
- Notifications.
- Project usage analytics.
- Dashboard members.
- User events.
- AI Copilot configuration.
- AI Copilot uploaded/crawled knowledge.

#### Encryption

Postgres and MongoDB data is encrypted at rest, including backups, replicas, and
snapshots.

### Cloudflare

Realtime collaboration data used in Multiplayer Editing and Presence is handled
by Cloudflare’s global edge network. This data is handled on the edge, as close
to the user as possible, to ensure low-latency performance. Because Cloudflare
manages routing dynamically across its global edge network, data processed in
WebSocket sessions is not guaranteed to remain within a specific geographic
region, apart from when region-locking is enabled.

Enterprise customers can choose to
[region lock data](/docs/platform/projects#Project-location) to `Cloudflare EU`
or `Cloudflare FedRAMP`, per project.

#### Stored in Cloudflare

- Multiplayer Editing data for text editor and sync engine integrations.
- AI Copilot message, tool, chat, and usage history.

#### Encryption

DurableObject data is encrypted at rest.

### Svix

Svix is used to deliver webhook messages.

#### Stored in Svix

- Webhook message data.

## Data deletion

### AI Copilots

Chat data is deleted by the user or client calling
[`useDeleteAiChat`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useDeleteAiChat).

### Comments

Comment data persists until the room is deleted with
[`deleteRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#delete-rooms-roomId) or
[Delete Room REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-rooms-roomId).
Additionally, individual threads and their comments can be deleted explicitly
with [`useDeleteThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useDeleteThread),
[`deleteThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#delete-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId)
or
[Delete Thread REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId).

Comments can also be deleted by their authors—when a single comment is deleted,
its body is cleared and marked with a `deletedAt` timestamp. When all comments
in a thread are deleted, the thread is deleted too.

### Multiplayer Editing

Multiplayer Editing data is deleted when the associated room is removed with
[`deleteRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#delete-rooms-roomId) or
[Delete Room REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-rooms-roomId).
Additionally, Storage data can be explicitly deleted with
[`deleteStorageDocument`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#delete-rooms-roomId-storage)
or
[Delete Storage Document REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-rooms-roomId-storage).

### Notifications

Notifications are persisted until explicitly deleted with
[`deleteInboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#delete-users-userId-inboxNotifications-inboxNotificationId)
or
[Delete Inbox Notification REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#delete-users-userId-inboxNotifications-inboxNotificationId).

### Presence

Presence data persists until a deletion request is submitted.

### Webhooks

Webhook messages data is automatically deleted after 90 days.
