### Monthly active users

Learn more about how monthly active users are calculated for each plan on our
[plans page](/docs/platform/plans).

### Simultaneous connections per room

Learn more about handling simultaneous room connection limits in our guide about
[joining rooms at maximum capacity](/docs/guides/what-happens-when-a-user-joins-a-room-at-maximum-capacity).

## Other limits

### `roomId` limit

A `roomId` cannot exceed 128 characters.

### `userId` limit

A `userId` cannot exceed 128 characters.

### `userInfo` limit

`userInfo` sent from the authentication endpoint cannot exceed 1024 characters
once serialized to JSON.

### Broadcast event limit

Broadcast event messages have a limit of 1 MB.

### Storage limits

- A `LiveObject` cannot exceed 128 kB when totalling the size of the keys and
  values.
- A `LiveMap` can be any size, so long as each individual value does not exceed
  128kB.
- A `LiveList` can be any size, so long as each individual value does not exceed
  128kB.

Note that when one real-time data structure is nested inside another, it does
not count towards the limit. Only the JSON leaves of your data structure count
towards the limit. For example, if a `LiveList` is nested inside a `LiveObject`,
the `LiveList` and its contents do not count towards the `LiveObject`â€™s data
limit.
