To learn more about how Monthly Active Users (MAU) are calculated for each plan,
take a look at the [pricing guide](/guides/pricing).

## Other limits

### Room `id`

A room `id` cannot exceed 128 characters.

### User `id`

A user `id` cannot exceed 128 characters.

### User information

User information sent from the authentication endpoint cannot exceed 1024
characters once serialized to JSON.

### Storage

- A `LiveObject` cannot exceed 128 kB when totalling the size of the keys and
  values.
- A `LiveMap` can be any size, so long as each individual value does not exceed
  128kB.
- A `LiveList` can be any size, so long as each individual value does not exceed
  128kB.

Note that when one real-time data structure is nested inside another, it does
not count towards the limit. Only the JSON leaves of your data structure count
towards the limit. For example, if a `LiveList` is nested inside a `LiveObject`,
the `LiveList` and its contents do not count towards the `LiveObject`'s data
limit.
