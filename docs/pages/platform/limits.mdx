To learn more about how monthly active users (MAU) are calculated for each plan,
take a look at the [plans](/platform/pricing) docs.

## Other limits

### `roomId` limit

A `roomId` cannot exceed 128 characters.

### `userId` limit

A `userId` cannot exceed 128 characters.

### `userInfo` limit

`userInfo` sent from the authentication endpoint cannot exceed 1024 characters
once serialized to JSON.

### Broadcast event limit

Broadcast event messages have a limit of 1 MB.

### Storage limits

- A `LiveObject` cannot exceed 128 kB when totalling the size of the keys and
  values.
- A `LiveMap` can be any size, so long as each individual value does not exceed
  128kB.
- A `LiveList` can be any size, so long as each individual value does not exceed
  128kB.

Note that when one real-time data structure is nested inside another, it does
not count towards the limit. Only the JSON leaves of your data structure count
towards the limit. For example, if a `LiveList` is nested inside a `LiveObject`,
the `LiveList` and its contents do not count towards the `LiveObject`'s data
limit.
