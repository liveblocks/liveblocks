Webhooks enable developers to extend the Liveblocks platform. From your system,
you can listen to events that get automatically triggered as users interact with
collaborative rooms.

## Configuring webhooks

To set up webhooks for your project, you’ll need to create an endpoint,
subscribe to events, and secure your endpoint.

- [Creating an endpoint](#creating-an-endpoint)
- [Subscribing to events](#subscribing-to-events)
- [Security verification](#security-verification)
- [Replaying events](#replaying-events)

### Creating an endpoint [#creating-an-endpoint]

If you would like to create an endpoint to receive webhook events, you will do
so from within the webhooks dashboard for your project.

1. From the <a href="/dashboard" target="_blank">dashboard</a> overview,
   navigate to the project you would like to add webhooks to
2. Click on the webhooks tab from the lefthand menu
3. Click the “Add Endpoint” button
4. Enter the URL of the endpoint you would like to use and a description of it
5. Select the events you would like to subscribe to (if you make no selections,
   all events will be sent to the endpoint)

Before sending events, disable CSRF protection for the endpoint if it is enabled
by default. Additionally, follow the steps outlined in the security verification
section before sending any events.

### Subscribing to events [#subscribing-to-events]

By default, each endpoint provided in the webhooks dashboard listens to all
events. However, you can easily configure it to only listen to a subset of
events by updating the "Subscribed events" section after creating the endpoint

1. Select the endpoint you would like to edit from the list of webhooks in the
   dashboard
2. Click the “Edit” button next to the “Subscribed events” section
3. Update event selections and click “Save”

    <source src="/assets/webhooks/edit-events.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

### Replaying events [#replaying-events]

If your service is unreachable, message retries are automatically re-attempted.
If your service incurs considerable downtime (over 8 hours), you can replay
individual messages from the Endpoints portion of the dashboard by clicking the
kebab menu on an individual message, or you can opt to bulk replay events by
clicking the main menu and selecting “Replay Failed Messages.”

<Figure>
  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source src="/assets/webhooks/replay-events.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

Each message is attempted based on a schedule that follows the failure of the
preceding attempt. If an endpoint is removed or disabled, delivery attempts will
also be disabled. The schedule for retries is as follows:

- Immediately
- 5 seconds
- 5 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 2 hours
- 5 hours
- 10 hours
- 10 hours (in addition to the previous)

For example, an attempt that fails three times before eventually succeeding will
be delivered roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds following the first attempt.

## Security verification [#security-verification]

Verifying webhooks prevents security vulnerabilities by safeguarding against
man-in-the-middle, CSRF, and replay attacks. Because of this, it is essential to
prioritize verification in your integration.

There are two ways to verify your webhooks, either manually or by using the
`@liveblocks/node` package. We highly recommend using the `@liveblocks/node`
package to verify and return fully typed events.

### With `@liveblocks/node`

#### 1. Install the package [@hidden]

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/node
```

#### 2. Setup the webhook handler [@hidden]

```ts
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(process.env.SECRET); // "whsec_..." obtained from the webhook dashboard
```

#### 3. Verify an event request [@hidden]

```ts
const event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
  headers: req.headers,
  rawBody: req.body,
});
```

The method will return a `WebhookEvent` object that is fully typed. You can then
use the event to perform actions based on the event type.

If the request is not valid, an error will be thrown.

#### Example [@hidden]

```ts
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Will fail if not properly initialized with a secret
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export default function webhookRequestHandler(req, res) {
  try {
    const event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: req.headers,
      rawBody: req.body,
    });

    // do things with the event
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return res.status(400).end();
  }

  res.status(200).end();
}
```

### Manual process

#### 1. Construct the signed content [@hidden]

The content to sign is composed by concatenating the request’s id, timestamp,
and payload, separated by the full-stop character (`.`). In code, it will look
something like:

```ts
const crypto = require("crypto");

// webhookId comes from the `webhook-id` header
// webhookTimestamp comes from the `webhook-timestamp` header
// body is the request body
signedContent = `${webhookId}.${webhookTimestamp}.${body}`;
```

#### 2. Generate the signature [@hidden]

Liveblocks uses an HMAC with SHA-256 to sign its webhooks.

So to calculate the expected signature, you should HMAC the `signedContent` from
above using the base64 portion of your signing secret (this is the part after
the `whsec_` prefix) as the key. For example, given the secret
`whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw` you will want to use
`MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw`.

For example, this is how you can calculate the signature in Node.js:

```ts
// Your endpoint’s signing secret
const secret = "whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw";

// Need to base64 decode the secret
const secretBytes = new Buffer(secret.split("_")[1], "base64");
// This is the signature you will compare against the signature header
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", secretBytes)
  .update(signedContent)
  .digest("base64");
```

#### 3. Validate the signature [@hidden]

The generated signature should match one of the signatures sent in the
`webhook-signature` header.

The `webhook-signature` header comprises a list of space-delimited signatures
and their corresponding version identifiers. The signature list is most commonly
of length one. Though there could be any number of signatures. For example:

```
v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE= v1,bm9ldHUjKzFob2VudXRob2VodWUzMjRvdWVvdW9ldQo= v2,MzJsNDk4MzI0K2VvdSMjMTEjQEBAQDEyMzMzMzEyMwo=
```

Make sure to remove the version prefix and delimiter (e.g., `v1`) before
verifying the signature.

#### 4. Verify the timestamp [@hidden]

As mentioned above, Liveblocks also sends the timestamp of the attempt in the
`webhook-timestamp` header. You should compare this timestamp against your
system timestamp and make sure it’s within your tolerance to prevent timestamp
attacks.

<Banner title="Comparing signatures">

We recommend implementing a constant-time string comparison method when
comparing signatures to prevent timing attacks.

## Liveblocks events

An event occurs when a change is made to Liveblocks data. Each endpoint you
provide in the webhooks dashboard listens to all events by default but can be
easily configured to only listen to a subset by updating the Message Filtering
section.

The Event Catalog in the webhooks dashboard provides a list of events available
for subscription, along with their schema.

Events available for use include:

- `StorageUpdated`
- `UserEntered/UserLeft`
- `RoomCreated/RoomDeleted`

More events will come later, such as:

- `MaxConnectionsReached`

#### UserEnteredEvent

When a user connects to a room, an event is triggered, indicating that the user
has entered. The `numActiveUsers` field shows the number of users in the room
after the user has joined. This event is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type UserEnteredEvent = {
  type: "userEntered";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    connectionId: number;
    userId: string | null;
    userInfo: Record<string, any> | null;
    enteredAt: string;
    numActiveUsers: number;
  };
};

// Example
const userEnteredEvent = {
  type: "userEntered",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    connectionId: 4,
    userId: "a-user-id",
    userInfo: null,
    enteredAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    numActiveUsers: 8,
  },
};
```

#### UserLeftEvent

A user leaves a room when they disconnect from a room, which is when this event
is triggered. The `numActiveUsers` field represents the number of users in the
room after the user has left. This event, like `UserEntered`, is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type UserLeftEvent = {
  type: "userLeft";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    connectionId: number;
    userId: string | null;
    userInfo: Record<string, any> | null;
    leftAt: string;
    numActiveUsers: number;
  };
};

// Example
const userLeftEvent = {
  type: "userLeft",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    connectionId: 4,
    userId: "a-user-id",
    userInfo: {
      name: "John Doe",
    },
    leftAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    numActiveUsers: 7,
  },
};
```

#### StorageUpdatedEvent

Storage is updated when a user writes to storage. This event is throttled at
five seconds and, as such, may not be triggered for every write.

For example, if a user writes to storage at 1:00 pm sharp, the
`StorageUpdatedEvent` event will be triggered shortly after. If the user writes
to storage again at 1:00 pm and 2 seconds, the `StorageUpdatedEvent` event will
be triggered five seconds after the first event was sent, around 1:00 pm and 5
seconds.

```ts
// Schema
type StorageUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "storageUpdated";
  data: {
    roomId: string;
    projectId: string;
    updatedAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const storageUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "storageUpdated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    updatedAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z", // 👈 time of the last write
  },
};
```

#### RoomCreatedEvent

An event is triggered when a room is created. This event is not throttled. There
are two ways for rooms to be created:

- By calling the
  [create room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms)
- When a user connects to a room that does not exist

```ts
// Schema
type RoomCreatedEvent = {
  type: "roomCreated";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    createdAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const roomCreatedEvent = {
  type: "roomCreated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    createdAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

#### RoomDeletedEvent

An event is triggered when a room is deleted. This event is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type RoomDeletedEvent = {
  type: "roomDeleted";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    deletedAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const roomDeletedEvent = {
  type: "roomDeleted",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    deletedAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

#### YDocUpdatedEvent

Yjs document is updated when a user makes a change to a Yjs doc connected to a
room. This event is throttled at five seconds and, as such, may not be triggered
for every write.

For example, if a user updates a Yjs document at 1:00 pm sharp, the
`YDocUpdatedEvent` event will be triggered shortly after. If the user writes to
the Yjs document again at 1:00 pm and 2 seconds, the `YDocUpdatedEvent` event
will be triggered 5 seconds after the first event was sent, around 1:00 pm
and 5 seconds.

```ts
// Schema
type YDocUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "ydocUpdated";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    deletedAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const ydocUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "ydocUpdated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    updatedAt: "2013-06-26T19:10:19Z",
  },
};
```

#### CommentCreatedEvent

An event is triggered when a comment is created. This event is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type CommentCreatedEvent = {
  type: "commentCreated";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    threadId: string;
    commentId: string;
    createdAt: string;
    createdBy: string;
  };
};

// Example
const commentCreatedEvent = {
  type: "commentCreated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    threadId: "my-thread-id",
    commentId: "my-comment-id",
    createdAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    createdBy: "my-user-id",
  },
};
```

#### CommentEditedEvent

An event is triggered when a comment is edited. This event is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type CommentEditedEvent = {
  type: "commentEdited";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    threadId: string;
    commentId: string;
    editedAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const commentEditedEvent = {
  type: "commentEdited",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    threadId: "my-thread-id",
    commentId: "my-comment-id",
    editedAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

#### CommentDeletedEvent

An event is triggered when a comment is deleted. This event is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type CommentDeletedEvent = {
  type: "commentDeleted";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    threadId: string;
    commentId: string;
    deletedAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const commentDeletedEvent = {
  type: "commentDeleted",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    threadId: "my-thread-id",
    commentId: "my-comment-id",
    deletedAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

#### ThreadCreatedEvent

An event is triggered when a thread is created. This event is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type ThreadCreatedEvent = {
  type: "threadCreated";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    threadId: string;
    createdAt: string;
    createdBy: string;
  };
};

// Example
const threadCreatedEvent = {
  type: "threadCreated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    threadId: "my-thread-id",
    createdAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    createdBy: "my-user-id",
  },
};
```

#### ThreadMetadaUpdatedEvent

An event is triggered when a thread metadata is updated. This event is not
throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type ThreadMetadataUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "threadMetadataUpdated";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    threadId: string;
    updatedAt: string;
    updatedBy: string;
  };
};

// Example
const threadMetadataUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "threadMetadataUpdated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    threadId: "my-thread-id",
    updatedAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    updatedBy: "my-user-id",
  },
};
```

## Use Cases

With webhooks, you can subscribe to the events you are interested in, and be
alerted of the change when it happens. Powerful ways to leverage webhooks with
Liveblocks include:

- Storage synchronization between room(s) and an internal database
- Monitoring user activity in a room
- Notifying the client if maximum concurrency has been reached

Webhooks are an excellent way to reduce development time and the need for
polling. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you’ll be able to
configure, subscribe to, secure, and replay webhook events with Liveblocks.
