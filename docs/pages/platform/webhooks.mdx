Webhooks enable developers to extend the Liveblocks platform. From your system,
you can listen to events that get automatically triggered as users interact with
collaborative rooms.

## Configuring webhooks

To set up webhooks for your project, you’ll need to create an endpoint,
subscribe to events, and secure your endpoint.

- [Creating an endpoint](#creating-an-endpoint)
- [Edit endpoint events](#edit-endpoint-events)
- [Security verification](#security-verification)
- [Replaying events](#replaying-events)
- [Testing locally](#testing-locally)

### Creating an endpoint [#creating-an-endpoint]

If you would like to create an endpoint to receive webhook events, you will do
so from within the webhooks dashboard for your project.

<Steps>
  <StepCompact>

    From the <a href="/dashboard" target="_blank">dashboard</a> overview, navigate
    to the project you’d like to add webhooks to.

  </StepCompact>

  <StepCompact>

    Click on the webhooks tab from the left-hand menu.

  </StepCompact>

  <StepCompact>

    Click the **“Create endpoint…”** button.

  </StepCompact>

  <StepCompact>

    Enter the URL of the endpoint you would like to use. Configure with your own
    endpoint or generate a
    <a href="https://www.svix.com/play/" target="_blank">Svix playground</a> link
    by clicking on **"use Svix play"**.

  </StepCompact>

  <StepCompact>

    Select the events you would like to subscribe to.

  </StepCompact>

  <StepCompact lastStep>

    Click **“Create endpoint”**.

  </StepCompact>

</Steps>

  <video width={1512} height={982} autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source src="/assets/webhooks/create-endpoint.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

Your endpoint must return a `2xx` (status code `200-299`) to indicate that the
event was successfully received. If your endpoint returns anything else, the
event will be retried, see [replaying events](#replaying-events) for more
details.

If all events fail to be delivered to your endpoint for 5 consecutive days, your
endpoint will automatically be disabled. You can always re-enable it from the
dashboard.

### Edit endpoint events [#edit-endpoint-events]

You can easily edit the events you want to subscribe to after creating an
endpoint.

<Steps>
  <StepCompact>

    Select the endpoint you would like to edit from the list of webhooks in the
    dashboard.

  </StepCompact>

  <StepCompact>

    Select **“Edit endpoint…”** from the top right dropdown.

  </StepCompact>

  <StepCompact lastStep>

    Update event selections and click **“Save changes”**.

  </StepCompact>

</Steps>

<Figure>
  <video width={1512} height={982} autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source src="/assets/webhooks/edit-events.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

### Replaying events [#replaying-events]

If your service is unreachable, message retries are automatically re-attempted.
If your service incurs considerable downtime (over 8 hours), you can replay
individual messages from the Endpoints portion of the dashboard by clicking the
kebab menu on an individual message, or you can opt to bulk replay events by
clicking the top right dropdown and selecting **“Recover failed messages…”**.

<Figure>
  <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline>
    <source src="/assets/webhooks/replay-events.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Figure>

Each message is attempted based on a schedule that follows the failure of the
preceding attempt. If an endpoint is removed or disabled, delivery attempts will
also be disabled. The schedule for retries is as follows:

- Immediately
- 5 seconds
- 5 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 2 hours
- 5 hours
- 10 hours
- 10 hours (in addition to the previous)

For example, an attempt that fails three times before eventually succeeding will
be delivered roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds following the first attempt.

## Security verification [#security-verification]

Verifying webhooks prevents security vulnerabilities by safeguarding against
man-in-the-middle, CSRF, and replay attacks. Because of this, it is essential to
prioritize verification in your integration. We recommend using the
`@liveblocks/node` package to verify and return fully typed events.

<Steps>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Install the package</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      ```bash
      npm install @liveblocks/node
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Set up the webhook handler</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Set up your webhook handler, inserting your secret key from the webhooks dashboard you
      set up earlier into [`WebhookHandler`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#WebhookHandler).

      ```ts
      import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

      // Insert your webhook secret key
      const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler("whsec_...");
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Verify an event request</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      We can verify a genuine webhook request with
      [`WebhookHandler.verifyRequest`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#verifyRequest)

      ```ts
      const event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
        headers: req.headers,
        rawBody: req.body,
      });
      ```

      <Banner title="rawBody takes a string" type="warning">

        Note that some frameworks parse request bodies into objects, so you may need to
        use `rawBody: JSON.stringify(req.body)` instead.

      </Banner>

      The method will return a `WebhookEvent` object that is fully typed. You can then
      use the event to perform actions based on the event type. If the request is not valid, an error will be thrown.

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>

    </StepTitle>

    <StepContent>

      Here’s an example from start to finish.

      ```ts
      import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

      // Will fail if not properly initialized with a secret
      const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler("whsec_...");

      export default function webhookRequestHandler(req, res) {
        try {
          const event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
            headers: req.headers,
            rawBody: req.body,
          });

          // Use the event, for example...
          if (event.type === "storageUpdated") {
            // { roomId: "my-room-name", projectId: "8sfhs5s...", ... }
            console.log(event.data);
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
          return res.status(400).end();
        }

        res.status(200).end();
      }
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

</Steps>

### Manually verify in Node.js

It’s also possible to manually verify your webhooks in Node.js, though it’s
unlikely this’ll be necessary.

<details>

<summary>How to manually verify webhook events in Node.js</summary>

<Steps>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Construct the signed content</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The content to sign is composed by concatenating the request’s id, timestamp,
      and payload, separated by the full-stop character (`.`). In code, it will look
      something like:

      ```ts
      const crypto = require("crypto");

      // webhookId comes from the `webhook-id` header
      // webhookTimestamp comes from the `webhook-timestamp` header
      // body is the request body
      signedContent = `${webhookId}.${webhookTimestamp}.${body}`;
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Generate the signature</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      Liveblocks uses an HMAC with SHA-256 to sign its webhooks.

      So to calculate the expected signature, you should HMAC the `signedContent` from
      above using the base64 portion of your webhook secret key (this is the part
      after the `whsec_` prefix) as the key. For example, given the secret
      `whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw` you will want to use
      `MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw`.

      For example, this is how you can calculate the signature in Node.js:

      ```ts
      // Your endpoint’s secret key
      const secret = "whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw";

      // Need to base64 decode the secret
      const secretBytes = new Buffer(secret.split("_")[1], "base64");
      // This is the signature you will compare against the signature header
      const signature = crypto
      .createHmac("sha256", secretBytes)
      .update(signedContent)
      .digest("base64");
      ```

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Validate the signature</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      The generated signature should match one of the signatures sent in the
      `webhook-signature` header.

      The `webhook-signature` header comprises a list of space-delimited signatures
      and their corresponding version identifiers. The signature list is most commonly
      of length one. Though there could be any number of signatures. For example:

      ```
      v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE= v1,bm9ldHUjKzFob2VudXRob2VodWUzMjRvdWVvdW9ldQo= v2,MzJsNDk4MzI0K2VvdSMjMTEjQEBAQDEyMzMzMzEyMwo=
      ```

      Make sure to remove the version prefix and delimiter (e.g., `v1`) before
      verifying the signature.

    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Verify the timestamp</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>

      As mentioned above, Liveblocks also sends the timestamp of the attempt in the
      `webhook-timestamp` header. You should compare this timestamp against your
      system timestamp and make sure it’s within your tolerance to prevent timestamp
      attacks.

      <Banner title="Comparing signatures">

        We recommend implementing a constant-time string comparison method when
        comparing signatures to prevent timing attacks.

### Manually verify in Elixir

It’s also possible to manually verify your webhooks in Elixir using
Plug/Phoenix, especially if you want to validate Liveblocks webhooks before
parsing the request body.

<details>

<summary>How to manually verify webhook events in Elixir</summary>

<Steps>

<Step>
<StepTitle>Construct the signed content</StepTitle>
<StepContent>

The signed content is composed by concatenating the webhook ID, timestamp, and
request body, separated by dots (`.`). In Elixir, it looks like this:

```elixir
signed_content = "#{webhook_id}.#{webhook_timestamp}.#{body}"
```

- `webhook_id` comes from the `"webhook-id"` header.
- `webhook_timestamp` comes from the `"webhook-timestamp"` header.
- `body` is the raw request body.

</StepContent>
</Step>

<Step>
<StepTitle>Generate the signature</StepTitle>
<StepContent>

Liveblocks signs webhooks using HMAC with SHA-256. You need to use the
base64-decoded portion of your secret (after the `whsec_` prefix) as the key.

Example in Elixir:

```elixir
secret = "whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw"

# Extract and decode the base64 part of the secret
secret_bytes =
  secret
  |> String.split("_")
  |> Enum.at(1)
  |> Base.decode64!()

# Compute the signature
signature =
  :crypto.mac(:hmac, :sha256, secret_bytes, signed_content)
  |> Base.encode64()
```

</StepContent>
</Step>

<Step>
<StepTitle>Validate the signature</StepTitle>
<StepContent>

The signature you just generated should match one of the signatures from the
`webhook-signature` header. That header contains space-separated values like:

```
v1,abc123= v1,def456= v2,ghi789=
```

You should extract just the Base64-encoded signature (the part after the comma):

```elixir
signature_header = get_req_header(conn, "webhook-signature") |> List.first()

webhook_signatures =
  signature_header
  |> String.split(" ")
  |> Enum.map(fn entry ->
    entry |> String.split(",") |> Enum.at(1)
  end)
```

Then check if your generated signature is in the list:

```elixir
if signature in webhook_signatures do
  # Valid signature
end
```

</StepContent>
</Step>

<Step>
<StepTitle>Verify the timestamp</StepTitle>
<StepContent>

Liveblocks includes a `webhook-timestamp` header to help prevent replay attacks.
You should check that the timestamp is within a reasonable window (e.g., 5
minutes):

```elixir
tolerance = 5 * 60
now = :os.system_time(:second)

case Integer.parse(webhook_timestamp) do
  {ts, _} when abs(now - ts) <= tolerance -> true
  _ -> false
end
```

</StepContent>
</Step>

<Step>
<StepTitle>Full example</StepTitle>
<StepContent>

Here’s the full code, as detailed to far.

```elixir title="Plug example" isCollapsed isCollapsable
defmodule App.Plugs.RequestValidator do

    {:ok, body, conn} = Plug.Conn.read_body(conn)

    signed_content = "#{webhook_id}.#{webhook_timestamp}.#{body}"

    secret_bytes =
      webhook_secret
      |> String.split("_")
      |> Enum.at(1)
      |> Base.decode64!()

    signature =
      :hmac
      |> :crypto.mac(:sha256, secret_bytes, signed_content)
      |> Base.encode64()

    if signature in webhook_signatures do
      if liveblocks_timestamp_valid?(webhook_timestamp) do
        params = Jason.decode!(body)

        conn
        |> Plug.Conn.assign(:request_validated, true)
        |> struct(%{body_params: params})
      else
        Logger.warning("[RequestValidator] Liveblocks webhook timestamp is not valid", %{
          timestamp: webhook_timestamp

        |> Plug.Conn.halt()
      end
    else
      Logger.warning("[RequestValidator] Liveblocks webhook signatures don't match", %{
        header_signature: webhook_signatures,
        calculated_signature: signature
      })

      conn
      |> Plug.Conn.put_status(:unauthorized)
      |> Phoenix.Controller.text("Incorrect signature")
      |> Plug.Conn.halt()
    end
  end

  def call(conn, _), do: conn

  defp liveblocks_timestamp_valid?(timestamp) do
    allowed_age = Application.get_env(:api, :liveblocks)[:webhook_timestamp_tolerance] || 5 * 60
    now = :os.system_time(:second)

    case Integer.parse(timestamp) do
      {ts, _} ->
        age = abs(now - ts)
        age <= allowed_age

      _ ->
        false
    end
  end
end
```

</StepContent>
</Step>

<Step lastStep>
<StepTitle>Add to your endpoint module</StepTitle>

Finally, to use the validator to your endpoint module, place it before
`Plug.parsers`.

```elixir
plug(App.Plugs.RequestValidator)
plug(Plug.Parsers, ...)
```

### Manually verify in Python

It's also possible to manually verify your webhooks in Python, especially if you want to validate Liveblocks webhooks in frameworks like Django or Flask.

<details>

<summary>How to manually verify webhook events in Python</summary>

The signed content is composed by concatenating the webhook ID, timestamp, and request body, separated by dots (`.`). In Python, it looks like this:

```python
signed_content = f"{webhook_id}.{webhook_timestamp}.{body}"
```

- `webhook_id` comes from the `"Webhook-Id"` header.
- `webhook_timestamp` comes from the `"Webhook-Timestamp"` header.
- `body` is the raw request body as a UTF-8 string.

# Extract and decode the base64 part of the secret
key = base64.b64decode(secret.split("_")[1])

# Compute the signature

tolerance = 5 * 60  # 5 minutes
now = int(time.time())

try:
    timestamp = int(webhook_timestamp)

## Testing locally [#testing-locally]

Running webhooks locally can be difficult, but there are several tools that
allow you to temporarily host your localhost server online.

### Using svix-cli

The [`svix-cli`](https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/tree/main/svix-cli) 
provides a `listen` command that creates a publicly accessible URL for testing
webhooks without requiring any account setup or network configuration changes.

If your project is running on `localhost:3000`, you can run the following
command to generate a temporary URL:

```bash
svix listen http://localhost:3000/api/liveblocks-webhook
```

This will output a unique URL that forwards all POST requests to your local
endpoint:

```
Webhook Relay is now listening at:
https://play.svix.com/in/c_tSdQhb4Q5PTF5m2juiWu8qFREqE/

All requests on this endpoint will be forwarded to your local URL:
http://localhost:3000/api/liveblocks-webhook

View logs and debug information at:
https://play.svix.com/view/c_tSdQhb4Q5PTF5m2juiWu8qFREqE/
```

The generated URL can be placed directly into the Liveblocks webhooks dashboard
for testing. This approach is particularly useful in enterprise environments
where tools like `localtunnel` or `ngrok` may be blocked by security policies.

### Using localtunnel or ngrok

Alternatively, you can use tools such as 
[`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) or
[`ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) which also allow you to
temporarily host your localhost server online.

If your project is running on `localhost:3000`, you can run the following
command to generate a temporary URL that’s available while your localhost server
is running:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

If you visit the page `localtunnel` links you to, and correctly input your IP
address, the URL it generates can be placed into the Liveblocks webhooks
dashboard for quick testing.

For a full step-by-step guide on testing with `localtunnel` and `ngrok`, read
the guide on
[how to test webhooks on localhost](/docs/guides/how-to-test-webhooks-on-localhost#Use-your-webhook-event).

## Source IP Addresses [#source-ips]

In case your webhook receiving endpoint is behind a firewall or NAT, you may
need to allow traffic from
[Svix's IP addresses](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/source-ips).

```
44.228.126.217
50.112.21.217
52.24.126.164
54.148.139.208
2600:1f24:64:8000::/52
```

## Liveblocks events

An event occurs when a change is made to Liveblocks data. Each endpoint you
provide in the webhooks dashboard listens to all events by default but can be
easily configured to only listen to a subset by updating the Message Filtering
section.

The Event Catalog in the webhooks dashboard provides a list of events available
for subscription, along with their schema.

Events available for use include:

- `StorageUpdated`
- `UserEntered/UserLeft`
- `RoomCreated/RoomDeleted`
- `YDocUpdated`
- `CommentCreated/CommentEdited/CommentDeleted`
- `CommentReactionAdded/CommentReactionRemoved`
- `ThreadCreated/ThreadDeleted/ThreadMetadataUpdated`
- `Notification`

More events will come later, such as:

- `MaxConnectionsReached`

#### UserEnteredEvent

When a user connects to a room, an event is triggered, indicating that the user
has entered. The `numActiveUsers` field shows the number of users in the room
after the user has joined. This event is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type UserEnteredEvent = {
  type: "userEntered";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    connectionId: number;
    userId: string | null;
    userInfo: Record<string, any> | null;
    enteredAt: string;
    numActiveUsers: number;
  };
};

// Example
const userEnteredEvent = {
  type: "userEntered",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    connectionId: 4,
    userId: "a-user-id",
    userInfo: null,
    enteredAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    numActiveUsers: 8,
  },
};
```

#### UserLeftEvent

A user leaves a room when they disconnect from a room, which is when this event
is triggered. The `numActiveUsers` field represents the number of users in the
room after the user has left. This event, like `UserEntered`, is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type UserLeftEvent = {
  type: "userLeft";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    connectionId: number;
    userId: string | null;
    userInfo: Record<string, any> | null;
    leftAt: string;
    numActiveUsers: number;
  };
};

// Example
const userLeftEvent = {
  type: "userLeft",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    connectionId: 4,
    userId: "a-user-id",
    userInfo: {
      name: "John Doe",
    },
    leftAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    numActiveUsers: 7,
  },
};
```

#### StorageUpdatedEvent

Storage is updated when a user writes to storage. This event is throttled at 60
seconds and, as such, may not be triggered for every write.

For example, if a user writes to storage at 1:00 pm sharp, the
`StorageUpdatedEvent` event will be triggered shortly after. If the user writes
to Storage again at 1:00 pm and 2 seconds, the `StorageUpdatedEvent` event will
be triggered 60 seconds after the first event was sent, around 1:01 pm.

On [Enterprise plans](/pricing) we can increase the throttle rate.

```ts
// Schema
type StorageUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "storageUpdated";
  data: {
    roomId: string;
    projectId: string;
    updatedAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const storageUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "storageUpdated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    updatedAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z", // 👈 time of the last write
  },
};
```

#### RoomCreatedEvent

An event is triggered when a room is created. This event is not throttled. There
are two ways for rooms to be created:

- By calling the
  [create room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms)
- When a user connects to a room that does not exist

```ts
// Schema
type RoomCreatedEvent = {
  type: "roomCreated";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    createdAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const roomCreatedEvent = {
  type: "roomCreated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    createdAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

#### RoomDeletedEvent

An event is triggered when a room is deleted. This event is not throttled.

```ts
// Schema
type RoomDeletedEvent = {
  type: "roomDeleted";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    deletedAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const roomDeletedEvent = {
  type: "roomDeleted",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    deletedAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

#### YDocUpdatedEvent

Yjs document is updated when a user makes a change to a Yjs doc connected to a
room. This event is throttled at sixty seconds and, as such, may not be
triggered for every write.

For example, if a user updates a Yjs document at 1:00 pm sharp, the
`YDocUpdatedEvent` event will be triggered shortly after. If the user writes to
the Yjs document again at 1:00 pm and 2 seconds, the `YDocUpdatedEvent` event
will be triggered 60 seconds after the first event was sent, around 1:01 pm

On [Enterprise plans](/pricing) we can increase the throttle rate.

```ts
// Schema
type YDocUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "ydocUpdated";
  data: {
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    updatedAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const ydocUpdatedEvent = {
  type: "ydocUpdated",
  data: {
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    updatedAt: "2013-06-26T19:10:19Z",
  },
};
```

    createdBy: "my-user-id",
  },
};

#### NotificationEvent

Notification events are designed to help you create notification emails for your
users. By default, they’re triggered 30 minutes after an activity occurs, but
this number can be modified in your [dashboard](/dashboard) inside a project’s
settings.

This webhook event is triggered by both Liveblocks and custom notification
`kinds`, as detailed below.

##### Thread notification

When using [Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments), an event is triggered
30 minutes after a user has been mentioned or replied to in a thread, and has
not seen the thread. It will also be triggered if the user has subscribed to the
thread and has not seen the thread. The event won’t be triggered if the user has
seen the thread or unsubscribed from the room’s thread notifications. This is
the Liveblocks `thread` notification kind.

```ts
// Schema
type ThreadNotificationEvent = {
  type: "notification";
  data: {
    channel: "email";
    kind: "thread";
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    userId: string;
    threadId: string;
    inboxNotificationId: string;
    // Date representing the time when the webhook event was created.
    createdAt: string;
    // Date representing the time when the notification itself was created.
    triggeredAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const threadNotificationEvent = {
  type: "notification",
  data: {
    channel: "email",
    kind: "thread",
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    userId: "my-user-id",
    threadId: "my-thread-id",
    inboxNotificationId: "my-inbox-notification-id",
    createdAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    triggeredAt: "2021-10-06T01:50:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

If you want to easily identify this event in your code then you can use the type
guard
[`isThreadNotificationEvent`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#isThreadNotificationEvent).

##### TextMention notification

When using [Text editor](/docs/ready-made-features/text-editor), an event is
triggered 30 minutes after a user has been mentioned in a text and has not seen
the text mention. This is the Liveblocks `textMention` notification kind.

```ts
// Schema
type TextMentionNotificationEvent = {
  type: "notification";
  data: {
    channel: "email";
    kind: "textMention";
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string;
    userId: string;
    mentionId: string;
    inboxNotificationId: string;
    // Date representing the time when the webhook event was created.
    createdAt: string;
    // Date representing the time when the notification itself was created.
    triggeredAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const textMentionNotificationEvent = {
  type: "notification",
  data: {
    channel: "email",
    kind: "textMention",
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    userId: "my-user-id",
    mentionId: "my-mention-id",
    inboxNotificationId: "my-inbox-notification-id",
    createdAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    triggeredAt: "2021-10-06T01:50:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

If you want to easily identify this event in your code then you can use the type
guard
[`isTextMentionNotificationEvent`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#isTextMentionNotificationEvent).

##### Custom notification

An event is triggered 30 minutes after the user has been notified of a custom
event and has not seen the notification. All custom notification `kinds` are
prefixed with `$` and are manually by you on the server. Learn more about
[triggering custom notifications](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-inbox-notifications-trigger).

```ts
// Schema
type CustomNotificationEvent = {
  type: "notification";
  data: {
    channel: "email";
    kind: "$yourKind"; // Can be any string starting with "$" as defined by the user
    projectId: string;
    roomId: string | null;
    userId: string;
    inboxNotificationId: string;
    // Date representing the time when the webhook event was created.
    createdAt: string;
    // Date representing the time when the notification itself was created.
    triggeredAt: string;
  };
};

// Example
const customNotificationEvent = {
  type: "notification",
  data: {
    channel: "email",
    kind: "$fileUpload",
    projectId: "my-project-id",
    roomId: "my-room-id",
    userId: "my-user-id",
    inboxNotificationId: "my-inbox-notification-id",
    createdAt: "2021-10-06T01:45:56.558Z",
    triggeredAt: "2021-10-06T01:50:56.558Z",
  },
};
```

If you want to easily identify this event in your code then you can use the type
guard
[`isCustomNotificationEvent`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#isCustomNotificationEvent).

## Use Cases

With webhooks, you can subscribe to the events you are interested in, and be
alerted of the change when it happens. Powerful ways to leverage webhooks with
Liveblocks include:

- Storage synchronization between room(s) and an internal database
- Monitoring user activity in a room
- Notifying the client if maximum concurrency has been reached

Webhooks are an excellent way to reduce development time and the need for
polling. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you’ll be able to
configure, subscribe to, secure, and replay webhook events with Liveblocks.

If you have any questions or need help using webhooks, please let us know
[by email](mailto:support@liveblocks.io) or by joining our
[Discord community](/discord)! We’re here to help!
