Liveblocks is designed to support real-time collaboration and AI features with a focus on performance, reliability, and privacy. While many aspects of data handling are managed by the platform, enterprise customers can configure certain behaviors related to data storage, retention, and region enforcement. This document outlines what data Liveblocks stores, where it is stored, and how deletion is handled.

## What Liveblocks Stores

In most cases, sensitive or personal information can be excluded from what's sent to Liveblocks. Additionally, expanded storage configuration and data control features are under active development for enterprise customers.

### Presence

- **Data stored**: Room ID, user ID (as defined by your authentication method), and approximate geolocation (based on IP address).
- **Purpose**: Used to display session events in the Liveblocks Dashboard.
- **Retention**: Persists until a deletion request is submitted.

### Comments

- **Data stored**: Comment body, author ID, timestamps, mentions, tags, and metadata.
- **Retention**: Persists until the room is deleted or a deletion request is submitted.

### Notifications

- **Data stored**: Notification message, delivery state, and recipient user ID.
- **Retention**: Persists until the room is deleted or a deletion request is submitted.

### Sync Engine

- **Data stored**: Collaborative state written to LiveObject, LiveMap, LiveList, or Yjs.
- **Purpose**: Powers real-time editing and syncing across users.
- **Retention**: Deleted when the associated room is removed or `deleteStorageDocument` is called.

### AI Copilots

- **Data stored**: Prompt configuration, LLM connection parameters (including API keys), message history, tool results, token usage, model usage, chat names, and metadata.
- **Optional add-on**: Knowledge storage requires saving text and vectors to support knowledge recall.
- **Retention**: Deleted when the user or client calls `deleteChat`.

## Storage Locations

### AWS

- **Default region**: `us-east-1`
- **Enterprise options**: Projects can be scoped to `us-east-1` or `eu-central-1`

**Stored in AWS:**
- Room metadata (ID, access, metadata)
- Comments
- Notifications
- Project usage analytics
- Dashboard members
- User events
- AI Copilot configuration
- AI Copilot uploaded/crawled knowledge

**Encryption**: Postgres and MongoDB data is encrypted at rest, including backups, replicas, and snapshots.

### Cloudflare

- **Purpose**: Handles real-time collaboration data via WebSocket and edge routing.
- **Region handling**: Data is processed as close to users as possible. Regional enforcement is only available for projects scoped to US or EU.

**Stored in Cloudflare:**
- Sync engine data
- AI Copilot message, tool, chat, and usage history

**Encryption**: DurableObject data is encrypted at rest.

### Svix

- **Purpose**: Delivers webhook messages.
- **Retention**: Messages are stored for 90 days and then deleted.
