### ReferenceError: process is not defined [#process-not-defined]

When calling `client.enterRoom()`, you stumble upon the following error:

```text
ReferenceError: process is not defined
```

The `@liveblocks/client` package expects to be consumed by a JavaScript bundler,
like Webpack, Babel, ESbuild, Rollup, etc. If you see this error, you have most
likely directly loaded the `@liveblocks/client` source code through a `<script>`
tag.

#### Solution [#process-not-defined-solution] [@hidden]

If using a bundler isn’t possible for you, there are two available solutions.

One solution is to load the source code from the
[Skypack CDN](https://www.skypack.dev/view/@liveblocks/client), which will
expose optimized production builds which have the `process` variable removed.

Another solution is to define the necessary `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable
manually, before loading the script, for example:

```ts
globalThis.process = { env: { NODE_ENV: "production" } };
```

### Why we’re asking you to pass unstable_batchedUpdates [#stale-props-zombie-child]

<Banner title="The best solution is to upgrade to React 18">

The last version of Liveblocks that supports the old React 17 version is 2.14.0.
To upgrade Liveblocks to 2.15 or higher, first upgrade React to 18.

Passing in `unstable_batchedUpdates` is no longer necessary on the latest
version of Liveblocks.

</Banner>

If you’re **on React 17 or lower**, there is a well-known problem that all state
management libraries need to deal with at some point, known as the
["Stale-props / zombie-child" problem](https://kaihao.dev/posts/Stale-props-and-zombie-children-in-Redux)—Liveblocks
is no exception.

This issue can cause catastrophic bugs, inconsistent renders, or—in the best
case—performance issues. Sooner or later, as your app grows in complexity, you
will run into some manifestation of this bug, and we want to be ahead of that.

Just do either of the following to avoid it!

1. **Just upgrade to React 18** (recommended)
1. If you cannot upgrade just yet, we ask you to pass the
   `unstable_batchedUpdates` function to the RoomProvider in the mean time, so
   Liveblocks can circumvent the issue on your behalf!

```tsx highlight="1,7"
import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from "react-dom";
//                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^ ...or "react-native"!
<RoomProvider
  id="my-room"
  initialPresence={/* ... */}
  initialStorage={/* ... */}
  unstable_batchedUpdates={unstable_batchedUpdates}
>
  <App />
</RoomProvider>;
```

Starting with 0.18.3, this will be enforced in React 17 and lower, potentially
saving hours of debugging.

#### What’s the problem, exactly? [#stale-props-zombie-child-details] [@hidden]

If you’re on React 17 or lower, state updates from “external” (non-DOM) events
will **not** get batched together automatically. If two or more of your
components subscribe to the same piece of state, and this state gets updated by
another user in the room, then both components will individually rerender,
separately.

In most cases this is just inefficient but not catastrophic. However, if you
happen to have a parent and child component that both rely on the same state,
this can lead to hard-to-debug bugs.

For example:

```tsx highlight="2,7"
function Parent() {
  const shapes = useStorage((root) => root.shapes);
  return shapes.map(({ id }) => <Child key={id} id={id} />);
}

function Child({ id }) {
  const shape = useStorage((root) => root.shapes.get(id));
  return <Shape x={shape.x} y={shape.y} />;
}
```

Both of these components need to get rerendered if, for example, some shape gets
deleted by another user in the room.

In React 17 (or lower), those rerenders will **not get batched together** and as
such they will not rerender together. Instead, they rerender individually,
separately. Which component rerenders first is undefined and often unpredictable
in larger apps. If you’re unlucky, this can lead to the Child component to get
rerendered before its Parent has had the opportunity to unmount it, which should
of course never happen.

By providing `unstable_batchedUpdates` to the RoomProvider, Liveblocks will wrap
all state updates in this helper, which will make sure that both Parent and
Child get rerendered as part of the same render cycle. This way, React will
ensure that the Parent component will always get rerendered before the Child.

## TypeScript issues [#typescript]

### Type "MyInterface" does not satisfy the constraint "Lson" [#lson-constraint-and-interfaces] [@keywords=["TS2344", "Lson", "LsonObject", "index signature missing"]]

If you found this page, chances are you stumbled upon this TypeScript error:

```text
TS2344: Type 'MyInterface' does not satisfy the constraint 'Lson'.
  Type 'MyInterface' is not assignable to type 'JsonObject'.
    Index signature for type 'string' is missing in type 'MyInterface'.
```

Liveblocks data structures (like `LiveObject`, `LiveMap`, and `LiveList`)
require that their payloads are always JSON-serializable to be able to send them
over WebSocket connections reliably and without surprises. Starting with 0.16,
we’re enforcing this with `Lson` type constraint. (LSON is a Liveblocks-specific
extension of JSON that also allows nesting more Live data structures.)

If you encounter this error above, TypeScript is trying to tell you that the
data type you are using in one of your Live structures is not (guaranteed to be)
a legal LSON (or JSON) value. But why?

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const people = new LiveList<Person>();
//                          ~~~~~~
//                          TS2344: Type "Person" does not
//                          satisfy the constraint "Lson" ☹️
```

Although this `Person` type seems perfectly JSON-serializable with only those
`string` and `number` fields, TypeScript still considers this a problem because
it cannot _guarantee_ that all of its subtypes will also be that. Interface
types are "open" and extensible by design. This means it’s possible to define a
subtype that would still not be JSON-serializable.
[Example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgArQM4HsTIN4BQyyIcAthAFzIZhSgDmA3EcnA1SQK5kBG0LAL4ECAelHIAanAA2XCBmRYYyAAYBRAG7AZ6KNhCrkZYAwAWYElkv9kAKQDKAeQByAWgzRgs4AC84vDIQADRiEgCeEJZwUCi0OjLImj4AJmp6BqoYBKCQsIgoWjoZOMgQAB6QICmKJbiExOLIgLwbgBB7rCDWDl4+-oGcXCAA1p0A7iBMjRIARIMjWOPTyDDAEDI1xqYWVjZxPTJ+AUEEwkA).

To fix this issue, there are roughly three available solutions.

#### Solution 1: Change your interface to a type [#lson-interface-solution1] [@hidden]

The simplest solution is to convert your `interface` to a `type`.

```ts highlight="1"
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const people = new LiveList<Person>();
//                          ^^^^^^ ✅ All good now
```

#### Solution 2: Extend your interface [#lson-interface-solution2] [@hidden]

You can also explicitly pledge that your interface will be JSON serializable by
having it extend from `JsonObject`.

```ts highlight="1,3"
import { JsonObject } from "@liveblocks/client";

interface Person extends JsonObject {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const people = new LiveList<Person>();
//                          ^^^^^^ ✅ All good now
```

#### Solution 3: Wrap the interface in a helper [#lson-interface-solution3] [@hidden]

This is the least preferred solution, but may be necessary if you don’t own the
interface definition and it’s coming from an external package.

```ts highlight="1,4"
import type { LiveList, EnsureJson } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { Person } from "some-external-package";

const people = new LiveList<EnsureJson<Person>>();
//                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ✅ All good now
```
