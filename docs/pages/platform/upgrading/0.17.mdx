---

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@0.17 @liveblocks/react@0.17
```

With the release of 0.17 we’re making a big investment in the stability and
reliability of Liveblocks. Our long term goal is to empower you to write and
help evolve your apps in the best way possible, and at enterprise scale. It
already was easy to get started with Liveblocks, and with these changes we want
to make _evolving_ your app just as easy.

The first step towards this goal is to take TypeScript support to the next level
for [`@liveblocks/client`][] and [`@liveblocks/react`][] (but our other packages
will soon follow suit). This will help you write code with confidence and catch
bugs as soon as possible in the development process. We have strictened our type
definitions to be more accurate and will recommend some new usage patterns, so
it will be easier for you to create _bug free_ collaborative apps.

To upgrade [`@liveblocks/client`][] and [`@liveblocks/react`][], run the
following command.

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@0.17 @liveblocks/react@0.17
```

With these changes, we’re clearing the path to enable schema validation per
room, automatic data migrations, more powerful data selector APIs, and other
enterprise-level features.

Let’s dive in and take a look!

## Changes in @liveblocks/react [#react]

### Lifting up your state to the room level [#lifting-state-to-room]

With 0.16, it was possible to initialize a storage key with [`useObject`][],
[`useList`][], [`useMap`][].

Even if handy, we realized that it introduced confusion and unpredictable
behavior for most users. Imagine a scenario where you have two components
initializing the same storage key.

```tsx
function ComponentA() {
  const author = useObject("author", {
    firstName: "Ada",
    lastName: "Lovelace",
  });

  /* ... */
}

function ComponentB() {
  const author = useObject("author", {
    firstName: "Margaret",
    lastName: "Hamilton",
  });

  /* ... */
}
```

Depending on which component renders first, `author` will be Margaret Hamilton
or Ada Lovelace. To make this more predictable, we’re deprecating this and
recommend initializing the storage at the [`RoomProvider`][] level.

#### Before ❌ [@hidden]

```tsx
function ComponentA() {
  const author = useObject(
    "author",

    // ⚠️ Don’t initialize your data here anymore!
    { firstName: "Ada", lastName: "Lovelace" }
  );

  /* ... */
}
```

#### After ✅ [@hidden]

```tsx highlight="5-10,13,20"
import { LiveObject } from "@liveblocks/client";

function Root() {
  // Instead, initialize it at the RoomProvider level to remove all ambiguity
  const initialStorage = {
    author: new LiveObject({
      firstName: "Ada",
      lastName: "Lovelace",
    }),
  };

  return (
    <RoomProvider id="my-room-id" initialStorage={initialStorage}>
      <ComponentA />
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}

function ComponentA() {
  const author = useObject("author");

  /* ... */
}
```

<Banner title="Explicitly specify your live structures now">

Notice the explicit use of LiveObject here now. Before, when using useObject (or
useList, useMap), the data you passed to initialize it would automatically get
wrapped in LiveObject for you. This seemed convenient at first, but it also
caused confusion about which Storage keys were Live structures and which ones
were “normal” values. By opting in to which keys you want to be Live structures,
you now get full control over your storage data.

### A better way to annotate your own types [#react-better-type-annotations]

In 0.16, most of our hooks accepted generic parameters that let you explicitly
provide your own types. For example:

```tsx highlight="3-5,11,19"
import { useMyPresence, RoomProvider } from "@liveblocks/react";

type Presence = {
  cursor: { x: number; y: number };
};

function Root() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider
      id="my-room-id"
      initialPresence={{ cursor: { x: 100, y: 100 } }}
    >
      <Component />
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}

function Component() {
  const [myPresence] = useMyPresence<Presence>();

  const cursor = myPresence.cursor; // Valid

  /* ... */
}
```

One issue with this API was that there was no good way to make sure that
`RoomProvider.initialPresence` and [`useMyPresence`][] types remain
synchronized, as there was no inherent connection between these.

If we added a `color` property to the `Presence` type, it would still be missing
from the `initialPresence` at the `RoomProvider` level, and TypeScript would not
be able to catch that bug. The opposite would also fail; omitting the `cursor`
property on the `initialPresence` would break at runtime but TypeScript would
not be able to catch this issue for you!

Another issue is that there could be many places where you’d have to provide
those extra type annotations.

With 0.17, we’re fixing all of this!

To do so, we’re introducing a new API called [`createRoomContext`][]. It lets
you type your `RoomProvider` and make sure that all your hooks types are
synchronized with the `RoomProvider`. Besides this initial setup, you will no
longer have to provide any type annotations elsewhere anymore.

```tsx
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { createRoomContext } from "@liveblocks/react";

const client = createClient({
  /* client options */
});

type Presence = {
  cursor: { x: number; y: number };
};

// This is just to illustrate the API - read on for tips on where to put this!
const { RoomProvider, useMyPresence } = createRoomContext<Presence>(client);

function Root() {
  return (
    <RoomProvider
      id="my-room-id"
      initialPresence={{ cursor: { x: 100, y: 100 } }}
    >
      <Component />
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}

function Component() {
  const [myPresence] = useMyPresence();

  // We can now be sure that cursor is a valid property without any generic typed param
  const cursor = myPresence.cursor;

  /* ... */
}
```

As you can see, `createRoomContext` optionally takes type parameters that let
you specify the shape of your app’s data (by specifying your own `Presence`,
`Storage`, `UserMeta`, `Event` types). Depending on the complexity of your app,
you may only need to use one or more of these.

Take a look at these examples to better see how to use and configure it:

- Our live-cursors-chat example app uses
  [`Presence`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/a11e5744531a21201ae9f9f9ad4f1aa5e74e141e/examples/nextjs-live-cursors-chat/liveblocks.config.ts#L8-L25)
  only
- Our live-avatars example app uses
  [`UserMeta`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/a11e5744531a21201ae9f9f9ad4f1aa5e74e141e/examples/nextjs-live-avatars/liveblocks.config.ts#L8-L26)
  only
- Our logo-builder example app uses
  [`Presence`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/a11e5744531a21201ae9f9f9ad4f1aa5e74e141e/examples/nextjs-logo-builder/liveblocks.config.ts#L8-L31),
  [`Storage`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/a11e5744531a21201ae9f9f9ad4f1aa5e74e141e/examples/nextjs-logo-builder/liveblocks.config.ts#L8-L31),
  and
  [`UserMeta`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/a11e5744531a21201ae9f9f9ad4f1aa5e74e141e/examples/nextjs-logo-builder/liveblocks.config.ts#L8-L31)

### Recommended upgrade steps

To make this refactoring as easy as possible, follow the steps below.

#### Step 1 - Upgrade `@liveblocks/client` and `@liveblocks/react` [@hidden]

To upgrade [`@liveblocks/client`][] and [`@liveblocks/react`], run the following
command.

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@0.17 @liveblocks/react@0.17
```

#### Step 2 - Create a new file called `liveblocks.config.ts` where you will create your Liveblocks client, provider and hooks and re-export them. [@hidden]

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { createRoomContext } from "@liveblocks/react";

const client = createClient({
  /* client options */
});

// Presence represents the properties that will exist on every User in the Room
// and that will automatically be kept in sync. Accessible through the
// `user.presence` property. Must be JSON-serializable.
type Presence = {
  // cursor: { x: number, y: number } | null,
  // ...
};

// Optionally, Storage represents the shared document that persists in the
// Room, even after all Users leave. Fields under Storage typically are
// LiveList, LiveMap, LiveObject instances, for which updates are
// automatically persisted and synced to all connected clients.
type Storage = {
  // author: LiveObject<{ firstName: string, lastName: string }>,
  // ...
};

// Optionally, UserMeta represents static/readonly metadata on each User, as
// provided by your own custom auth backend (if used). Useful for data that
// will not change during a session, like a User's name or avatar.
// type UserMeta = {
//   id?: string,  // Accessible through `user.id`
//   info?: Json,  // Accessible through `user.info`
// };

// Optionally, the type of custom events broadcasted and listened for in this
// room. Must be JSON-serializable.
// type RoomEvent = {};

export const {
  RoomProvider,
  useMyPresence,
  useObject,
  /* ...all the other hooks you’re using... */
} = createRoomContext<Presence, Storage /* UserMeta, RoomEvent */>(client);
```

#### Step 3 - Replace all the direct hook imports from `@liveblocks/react` by your path to `liveblocks.config.ts` and remove all generic params. [@hidden]

##### Before ❌ [@hidden]

```tsx
import { useMyPresence, useOthers, useObject } from "@liveblocks/react";
import { Author } from "./types";

type MyPresence = {
  cursor: { x: number; y: number } | null;
};

function Component() {
  const author = useObject<Author>("author");
  const [{ cursor }] = useMyPresence<MyPresence>();
  const others = useOthers<Presence>();
}
```

##### After ✅ [@hidden]

```tsx
import { useMyPresence, useOthers, useObject } from "./liveblocks.config";

function Component() {
  const author = useObject("author");
  const [{ cursor }] = useMyPresence();
  const others = useOthers();
}
```

#### Step 4 - Remove your [`LiveblocksProvider`][] at the top of your react tree. It’s not needed anymore! [@hidden]

##### Before ❌ [@hidden]

```tsx
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { LiveblocksProvider, RoomProvider } from "@liveblocks/react";

const client = createClient({
  /* ... */
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <LiveblocksProvider client={client}>
    <RoomProvider id="my-room-id">
      <App />
    </RoomProvider>
  </LiveblocksProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

##### After ✅ [@hidden]

```tsx
import { RoomProvider } from "./liveblocks.config";

ReactDOM.render(
  <RoomProvider id="my-room-id">
    <App />
  </RoomProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## Changes in @liveblocks/client [#client]

### Removed dangerous default type params [#no-more-default-type-params]

In 0.16, while [`LiveList`][], [`LiveMap`][], [`LiveObject`][] were generics,
they also took default type params, which made them a footgun. It was easy to
accidentally use them in a way that would discard useful type information and
hinder inference.

For example:

```ts
// ✅ Inferred
let list = new LiveList([1, 2, 3]);

// ✅ Explicit
let list: LiveList<number> = new LiveList([1, 2, 3]);

// ☢️ 0.16: Dangerous footgun: discards useful type information!
// 🚫 0.17: No longer possible
let list: LiveList = new LiveList([1, 2, 3]);
```

They now mimic their equivalent built-in TypeScript generics, so:

- `LiveList<T>` is now just like `Array<T>`
- `LiveMap<K, V>` is now just like `Map<K, V>`
- `LiveObject<{ a: number, b: string }>` is now just like
  `{ a: number, b: string }`

### No longer import Presence [#define-dont-import-presence]

In 0.16, we exposed a `Presence` type that you could import, which was just an
alias for “any JSON object”—not that useful! Importing Presence from Liveblocks
made no sense. By definition, Presence is data owned and defined by your
application after all.

You should no longer need to _import_ this type.

```tsx
// ❌ No longer need to _import_ Presence
import type { Presence } from "@liveblocks/client";

client.enter<Presence>("myRoom");
```

Instead, just _define_ it:

```tsx
// ✅ Just define the shape your app needs
type Presence = {
  cursor: { x: number; y: number } | null;
};

client.enter<Presence>("myRoom");
```

### A better way to annotate your own types [#client-better-type-annotations]

We already talked about why, in React, we
[improved the way you can annotate your own app’s data](#react-better-type-annotations),
by annotating the types only once, at the “top” of your app.

For the same reason, we’re doing a similar thing in the client package.

<Banner title="You may not need this">

This section only applies if you’re not using the React package.

</Banner>

```tsx highlight="18-21,24"
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { Author } from "./types";

const client = createClient({
  /* client options */
});

type Presence = {
  cursor: { x: number; y: number } | null;
};

type Storage = {
  author: LiveObject<Author>;
};

// ❌ In 0.16, you had to annotate each method separately
const room = client.enter("myRoom");
const { root } = await room.getStorage<Storage>();
const author = root.get<Author>("author");
const me = room.getPresence<Presence>();
const others = room.getOthers<Presence>();

// ✅ In 0.17, you can simply annotate it once, at the "top"
const room = client.enter<Presence, Storage>("myRoom");
const { root } = await room.getStorage();
const author = root.get("author");
const me = room.getPresence();
const others = room.getOthers();
```
