There’s a tiny breaking change related to Comments in this update. Each date
returned is now a `Date` object, whereas previously each was a `string`.

## How to upgrade? [#how]

You can upgrade to 1.9 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks
package you’re using, for example in a React app:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@latest @liveblocks/react@latest @liveblocks/react-comments@latest @liveblocks/node@latest
```

If you’re using any other Liveblocks packages make sure to update those too.

## Dates are no longer strings

Each date returned from Comments is now a `Date` object, whereas previously each
was a `string`. An example of this is `createdAt`, a value attached to each
thread.

Before:

```tsx
// ❌ Before - Liveblocks 1.8
const { threads } = useThreads();

// "2023-12-15T14:15:22Z"
console.log(threads[0].createdAt);
```

After:

```tsx
// ✅ After - Liveblocks 1.9
const { threads } = useThreads();

// Date <Fri Dec 15 2023 14:15:22 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)>
console.log(threads[0].createdAt);
```

Every Comments-related date has been updated, such as `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
properties in threads, and `editedAt`, `deletedAt` in comments, so take care to
check every date instance you’re using. It’s likely that no changes are required
after this update.
