```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@0.18 @liveblocks/react@0.18
```

With the release of 0.18 we‚Äôre bringing some exciting and pretty major
improvements to our React hooks, letting you build apps with ease and with more
control over the exact behavior.

The new APIs we‚Äôre introducing here solve many subtle and not-so-subtle pain
points. We heard your feedback, and think we have shipped something awesome that
you‚Äôll love.

This guide consists of two sections:

1. Introduction of the new APIs to get a taste of the new features
2. Recommended upgrade steps to get the most out of it for your app
   ([jump straight to it](#upgrade-steps))

Let‚Äôs dive right in!

## Changes in @liveblocks/react [#react]

With 0.18, the biggest conceptual shift is that our hooks to consume data from
Liveblocks now return normal JavaScript data structures (objects, arrays, maps)
that are _immutable_ by default.

Suppose you have initialized your room with:

```tsx highlight="5-9"
<RoomProvider
  id="my-room"
  initialPresence={/* ... */}
  initialStorage={{
    scientist: new LiveObject({
      firstName: "Ada",
      lastName: "Lovelace",
      pets: new LiveList(["üê∂", "üêà"]),
    }),
  }}
>
  <App />
</RoomProvider>
```

### Accessing nested data [#nested-data]

Reading nested data from there is now much easier:

#### Previously ‚ùå [@hidden]

```tsx
function Component() {
  const scientist = useObject("scientist");
  if (scientist == null) {
    return null;
  }

  const pets = scientist.get("pets").toArray();
  // ["üê∂", "üêà"]
}
```

#### Now ‚úÖ [@hidden]

```tsx
function Component() {
  const pets = useStorage((root) => root.scientist.pets);
  // ["üê∂", "üêà"]
}
```

As you can see, because we can read data with normal JavaScript data structures,
accessing nested data is now straightforward.

### Subscribing to updates is automatic now [#subscriptions]

Rerendering your components when nested data‚Äîlike our scientist‚Äôs pets
list‚Äîchanges was a true head breaker before. This required extra helper
components, manual subscriptions, and manual conversion to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù JavaScript
arrays.

Now, rerendering your component when data changes is automatic, even for deeply
nested data.

#### Previously ‚ùå [@hidden]

```tsx
function Component() {
  const scientist = useObject("scientist");
  if (scientist == null) {
    return null;
  }

  return <Pets livePets={scientist.get("pets")} />;
}

function Pets({ livePets }) {
  const room = useRoom();
  const [pets, setPets] = useState(livePets.toArray());

  useEffect(() => {
    return room.subscribe(livePets, () => {
      setPets(livePets.toArray());
    });
  }, [room, livePets]);
}
```

#### Now ‚úÖ [@hidden]

```tsx
function Component() {
  const pets = useStorage((root) => root.scientist.pets);
  // ["üê∂", "üêà"]
}
```

There is no typo in this example. This is the actual code.

### Multiple subscriptions are just as easy [#multi-subscriptions]

Previously, if you wanted to derive a computed value from multiple storage
values, it took some manual setup to ensure the component would automatically
rerender when either of those values changed.

Now, this is fully automatic. Or should we say, automagic?

#### Previously ‚ùå [@hidden]

```tsx highlight="11"
function Component() {
  const objA = useObject("a");
  const objB = useObject("b");

  const room = useRoom();
  const [sum, setSum] = useState();
  //     ^^^ We‚Äôre trying to compute the result of a.x + b.x in here

  useEffect(() => {
    function onChange() {
      setSum(objA.get("x") + objB.get("x"));
    }

    const unsubA = room.subscribe(objA, onChange);
    const unsubB = room.subscribe(objB, onChange);

    return () => {
      unsubA();
      unsubB();
    };
  }, [room, objA, objB]);
}
```

#### Now ‚úÖ [@hidden]

```tsx
function Component() {
  const sum = useStorage((root) => root.a.x + root.b.x);
}
```

This component will rerender automatically any time `a.x` or `b.x` changes, but
not more often.

### Guaranteed referential equality [#referential-equality]

Previously we returned mutable Live structures for performance reasons because
converting live changing data to JavaScript data structures constantly (and
recursively) was previously too slow to do on every render. This led to
unintuitive behavior when used with React hooks dependencies.

Not anymore! Due to a technique called structural sharing, we‚Äôre now able to
_guarantee_ for nodes in the Storage tree that as long as their (direct or
nested) contents haven‚Äôt changed in Storage, their immutable representation will
remain to be the same object references on the next render. This means that you
can rely on referential equality, as you may have expected in the first place.

#### Previously ‚ùå [@hidden]

```tsx
function Component() {
  const scientist = useObject("scientist");

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect never triggered when scientist (or their pets list) changes! :(
  }, [scientist]);
}
```

#### Now ‚úÖ [@hidden]

```tsx
function Component() {
  const scientist = useStorage((root) => root.scientist);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect triggered every time scientist (or their pets list) changes! :)
    // But not more often than that!
  }, [scientist]);
}
```

### Suspense support

Starting with 0.18, all hooks that read data from Liveblocks come with a
Suspense version of the hook which will never return `null` to indicate the
‚Äústill loading‚Äù state. Instead, they will suspend the rendering of the component
tree until Liveblocks has finished loading.

We recommend you to adopt Suspense if you can because it lets you get rid of the
ugly `null` checks, helper components to ‚Äúeat off‚Äù those null cases, and the
prop drilling that necessarily comes with all that.

#### Previously ‚ùå [@hidden]

```tsx
function Component() {
  const camera = useObject("camera");
  const items = useList("items");

  // üëé
  if (camera == null || items == null) {
    return <div>Still loading...</div>;
  }

  return <MyRealComponent camera={camera} items={items} />;
}
```

#### Now ‚úÖ [@hidden]

Set up a Suspense boundary once:

```tsx file="App.tsx" highlight="6"
import { Suspense } from "react";

function Setup() {
  return (
    // Once
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <App />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

Switch to use the Suspense versions of our hooks instead of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ones:

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="2"
export const {
  suspense: {
    RoomProvider,
    useStorage,
    /* etc. */
  },
} = createRoomContext(client);
```

Then, enjoy no more null checks everywhere in your app:

```tsx file="Component.tsx"
function Component() {
  const camera = useStorage((root) => root.camera);
  const items = useStorage((root) => root.items);
  // No more null checking! :)
}
```

## Recommended upgrade steps [#upgrade-steps]

To get the most out of the new hooks, we recommend following the steps below to
gradually upgrade your app to make use of the new hooks.

### Step 1: Install the latest package [@hidden]

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@0.18 @liveblocks/react@0.18
```

### Step 2: Make sure you‚Äôre setting initial presence [@hidden]

We now require setting an initial presence value when you connect to a room
explicitly. This ensures that every user is guaranteed to always have a known
presence value.

Check that you have this in your config file:

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="3"
<RoomProvider
  id="my-room"
  initialPresence={{}}
  //              ^^^^ No longer optional
>
  <App />
</RoomProvider>
```

If your app somehow doesn‚Äôt use Presence, you can just set an empty object
(`{}`) here.

### Step 3: You can remove some uncertainty from user instances [@hidden]

If you have expressions in your code that look like...

```tsx
user.info?.avatar;
//       ^
user.presence?.cursor.x;
//           ^
```

You can now remove these optional chainings. The fields `info` and `presence`
will now always be set on `User` instances.

### Step 4: Adopt Suspense (optional) [@hidden]

Now is a great moment to opt-in to Suspense (see the
[React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#suspense)) with Liveblocks,
if you can or want to use it in your app. We recommend it for most apps because
it makes working with the new hooks even nicer.

To avoid repeating ourselves, please follow the instruction below.

<Banner title="Adopting Suspense">

Follow
[these instructions to adopt Suspense](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#suspense).
Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll wait.

</Banner>

Now that you have updated your app to Suspense, you should be able to remove all
these pesky `null` checks from your code.

```tsx highlight="6-8"
function Component() {
  const a = useMap("a");
  const b = useList("b");
  const c = useObject("c");

  if (a == null || b == null || c == null) {
    return <Loading />;
  }

  /* ... */
}
```

Afterward, please verify that your app still works like normal.

### Step 5a: Replace reads with `useStorage` [@hidden]

We recommend rewriting all usages of `useList`, `useObject` and `useMap` if
those are used for _reading_ data only. If used only for reading values from
Storage, you could turn these into an equivalent `useStorage` call, which has
fewer gotchas.

For example, change:

```tsx
// ‚ùå
const obj = useObject("a");
const list = useObject("b");
const map = useMap("c");
```

to:

```tsx
// ‚úÖ
const obj = useStorage((root) => root.a);
const list = useStorage((root) => root.b);
const map = useStorage((root) => root.c);
```

Note that the `root` argument you receive here is the immutable normal
JavaScript equivalent of your entire Storage tree, as returned by calling
[`.toImmutable`][].

So this means that if you have been manually converting the mutable Live
structures to normal data structures, you no longer have to do this:

```tsx
// ‚ùå
obj.toObject();
list.toArray();
```

```tsx
// ‚úÖ
obj; // Already a normal JS object
list; // Already a normal JS array
```

Please note that `useList`, `useObject`, or `useMap` are not deprecated and
still work with the same behavior as before. We just no longer recommend their
use.

### Step 5b: Replace mutations with useMutation [@hidden]

If you are (also) using `useList`, `useObject` or `useMap` to obtain a mutable
reference to the Live structure to _mutate_ it, you can rewrite those use cases
to use the new `useMutation` hook instead.

For example:

```tsx
// ‚ùå
const obj = useObject("a");

return (
  <input
    value={obj.get("name")}
    //         ^^^ Live object used for reading
    onClick={() => {
      obj.set("name", e.currentTarget.value);
      //  ^^^ Live object used for mutating
    }}
  />
);
```

The idiomatic way to deal with Storage is to _consume_ data using simple/normal
JS data structures and to _mutate_ data using a callback function that you can
create with `useMutation`, which provides access to the mutable Live structures.

```tsx
// ‚úÖ
const name = useStorage((root) => root.a.name);

const setName = useMutation(({ storage }, newName) => {
  storage.get("a").set("name", newName);
  //               ^^^ Mutation goes here
}, []);

return (
  <input
    value={name}
    //     ^^^^ Reading uses simple values
    onClick={(e) => setName(e.currentTarget.value)}
  />
);
```

Even though in this contrived example it may look more complicated, in large
apps this pattern will vastly simplify your app‚Äôs complexity.

See the [`useMutation`][] documentation to learn all the details, because it has
a lot more in store.

### Step 6: Get rid of `room.subscribe()` calls [@hidden]

Historically the only way to get full control over exactly when and how your
components would rerender was to use the low-level `room.subscribe()` API.

Most, if not all, of these use cases can be replaced by an equivalent, yet much
simpler call to `useStorage` with a selector function that does an equivalent
thing.

**Common use case: subscribing to nested data**  
If you are using `room.subscribe` to manually rerender components when nested
data changes, you can replace it by ‚Äújust‚Äù selecting the nested fields you‚Äôre
interested in. See [this example](#subscriptions).

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Automatically rerenders if pets changes (but not more often)
const nested = useStorage((root) => root.scientist.pets);
```

**Common use case: subscribing to a computed value**  
If you are using `room.subscribe` to synchronize a computation based on multiple
storage values, you can replace it by ‚Äújust‚Äù doing the computation in See
[this example](#multi-subscriptions).

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Automatically rerenders if computed value changes
const sum = useStorage((root) => root.a + root.b);
```

If you have another use case for `room.subscribe` that you think isn‚Äôt possible
to express in an equivalent `useStorage` call, please
[let us know about it](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/discussions/504).
We‚Äôre happy to help!

### Step 7: Get rid of manual batch calls [@hidden]

Most, if not all, cases of manually calling `useBatch` or `room.batch` should no
longer be needed and can be replaced by `useMutation`, which automatically
batches already!

That‚Äôs it!
