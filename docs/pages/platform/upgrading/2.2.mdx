You must upgrade to 2.0 first, please follow the
[2.0 upgrade guide](/docs/platform/upgrading/2.0).

We are making `resolved` a first-class citizen property on
[threads](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/concepts#Threads). You don’t have
to use a thread’s metadata to set a thread as resolved anymore.

## How to upgrade? [#how]

You can upgrade to 2.2 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks
package you’re using. The easiest way to do that is to run the following
command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --upgrade
```

## All changes are for Comments

If you are not using Comments or are not using the `resolved` metadata property,
there are no breaking changes for you! However, if you are and have logic based
on the webhook event `threadMetadataUpdated`, keep reading.

### Webhook events

When you upgrade to 2.2, the default
[`Thread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Thread) component will update
the thread’s first-class citizen property instead of the metadata. When a thread
is marked as resolved or unresolved, we will send the events
[`threadMarkedAsResolved`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadMarkedAsResolvedEvent)
and
[`threadMarkedAsUnresolved`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadMarkedAsUnresolvedEvent)
instead of
[`threadMetadataUpdated`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadMarkedAsUnresolvedEvent).

Before upgrading to 2.2, you should update your webhook endpoint to process
those new events accordingly.

### REST API endpoints

If you use the REST endpoint
[`Edit thread metadata`](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId-metadata)
to update the metadata `resolved`, you should instead use the endpoints
[`Mark thread as resolved`](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId-mark-as-resolved)
and
[`Mark thread as unresolved`](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId-mark-as-unresolved).

Note that updating the `resolved` metadata property automatically updates the
first-class citizen one.
