We are introducing attachments to allow users to add files to their comments.

## How to upgrade? [#how]

You can upgrade to 2.8 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks
package you’re using. The easiest way to do that is to run the following
command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --upgrade
```

## All changes are for Comments

If you are not using Comments or are not using
[the default Comments components](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/default-components),
there are no breaking changes for you! However, if you are, or intend to use
them later, keep reading.

## Attachments

Liveblocks 2.8 adds attachments to Comments, and while not a breaking change, it
is mostly enabled by default in the default components. We recommend you either
[enable attachments](#enable-attachments) or
[disable attachments](#disable-attachments) when you upgrade.

### Enable attachments [#enable-attachments]

Attachments are enabled by default, but if you’re using
[`useCreateThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useCreateThread),
[`useCreateComment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useCreateComment), or
[`useEditComment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useEditComment), you can
now pass these an attachments array.

```tsx
const createThread = useCreateThread();

// ❌ Before - Liveblocks 2.7
createThread({ body: {}, metadata: {} });

// ✅ After - Liveblocks 2.8
createThread({ body: {}, attachments: [], metadata: {} });
```

These hooks are most commonly used to enable
[custom Composer behavior](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Custom-behavior)
with `onComposerSubmit`, which now provides the `attachments` array for you. You
must pass this to your mutations for attachments to work correctly.

```tsx
const createThread = useCreateThread();

// ❌ Before - Liveblocks 2.7
<Composer
  onComposerSubmit={({ body }, event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    createThread({ body, metadata: {} });
  }}
/>

// ✅ After - Liveblocks 2.8
<Composer
// +++
  onComposerSubmit={({ body, attachments }, event) => {
    // +++
    event.preventDefault();
    // +++
    createThread({ body, attachments, metadata: {} });
    // +++
  }}
/>
```

Remember that this applies to
[`useCreateComment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useCreateComment) and
[`useEditComment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useEditComment) too, not
just [`useCreateThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useCreateThread).
No further changes are necessary to enable attachments in the default
components.

{/* TODO If you’re using primitives you must ... */}

### Disable attachments [#disable-attachments]

If you’d prefer to disable attachments, you can do so by setting the
`showAttachments` prop to `false` on each of the following components:
[`Composer`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Composer),
[`Comment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Comment),
[`Thread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Thread), and
[`InboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#InboxNotification.Thread).

```tsx
// Disable attachments
<Composer showAttachments={false} ... />
<Comment showAttachments={false} ... />
<Thread showAttachments={false} ... />
<InboxNotification showAttachments={false} ... />
```

## Default Composer component structure

The default [`Composer`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Composer)
component’s structure has slightly changed, so if you customized its styles:
make sure to check if and how the new structure affects your changes.

```html
<!-- ❌ Before - Liveblocks 2.7 -->
<form class="lb-root lb-composer lb-composer-form">
  <!-- The editor and its controls -->
</form>

<!-- ✅ After - Liveblocks 2.8 -->
<form class="lb-root lb-composer lb-composer-form">
  <div class="lb-composer-editor-container">
    <!-- The editor and its controls -->
  </div>
</form>
```
