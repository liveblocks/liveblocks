---

There are no breaking changes in this update, however we are introducing a new
authentication method. If you’re currently using `createClient()` with the
`authEndpoint` option, we recommend you read on.

Liveblocks 1.2 provides new ways to specify who can access certain rooms, and
with which permissions they can enter. Our new-style security tokens also bring
speed improvements, allowing clients to connect Liveblocks rooms even quicker,
as well as permitting authorization tokens that can be used for multiple rooms.

## Public key authentication changes [#public-auth-changes]

<Banner type="success" title="No changes required">
  If you’re currently using Liveblocks **public keys**, no changes are required.
</Banner>

With Liveblocks 1.2, entering rooms with your public key will be noticeably
quicker. If you’re currently using Liveblocks public keys, no changes are
required to your application.

## Private key authentication changes [#private-auth-changes]

<Banner type="warning" title="We recommend changing your auth back end">
  If you’re currently using Liveblocks **private keys** we **highly recommend**
  you upgrade your auth back end.
</Banner>

Upgrading your existing auth back end will opt you in to using our new-style
auth tokens, which offer the following benefits:

- Grant users permission to multiple rooms in one transaction, meaning fewer
  requests on your back end.
- Much quicker to join rooms, particularly any after the first.
- Unlock access to upcoming features, such as [Comments](/comments).

If you’re currently using Liveblocks private keys, no changes are strictly
necessary, but we do highly recommend you upgrade your application’s back end.

## How to upgrade? [#how]

You can upgrade to 1.2 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks
package you’re using, for example in a React app:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@latest @liveblocks/node@latest @liveblocks/react@latest
```

<Banner title="Update every Liveblocks package">

If you’re using any other Liveblocks packages make sure to update those too.

</Banner>

We’ll walk you through the necessary changes below, but first, if you currently
have a Liveblocks application in production, we recommend following a rollout
plan, to prevent any users running an old Liveblocks client, during the upgrade,
from having issues.

### Rollout plan

<Steps>
  <StepCompact>
    Keep your existing back end endpoint (e.g. `/api/auth`).
  </StepCompact>

<StepCompact>
  Create a new authentication endpoint for the upgrade (e.g.
  `/api/liveblocks-auth`).
</StepCompact>

<StepCompact>
  In your front end, point `createClient()`’s `authEndpoint` URL to the new
  endpoint.
</StepCompact>

<StepCompact>Done! You can deploy your application now.</StepCompact>

  <StepCompact lastStep>
    Later, when all your application’s clients have been upgraded to the latest version, you can safely remove the old endpoint.
  </StepCompact>
</Steps>

## Deciding which token to use [#deciding]

In Liveblocks 1.2 there are two new ways to authenticate with
`@liveblocks/node`.

- [Access tokens](#access-tokens) are recommend for most applications.
- [ID tokens](#id-tokens) are best if you’re using fine-grained permissions with
  our REST API.

Access tokens and ID tokens both allow for multiple room support, but have
different sources of truth. The old authentication method, single-room tokens
with `authorize`, is still supported but will eventually be deprecated.

## Access tokens [#access-tokens]

Access tokens are the new recommended way to authenticate, because they’re easy
to manage from your custom back end. They follow the analogy of a _hotel key
card_. Anyone that has a key card can enter any room that the card gives access
to. It’s easy to give out these key cards right from your back end.

### Upgrading to access tokens [#upgrade-to-access-tokens]

First, create a new endpoint in your back end, next to your existing `/api/auth`
endpoint. We recommend going with `/api/liveblocks-auth`.

Let’s implement it to issue tokens that would be equivalent to your current
single-room token based setup.

<Steps>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Create a client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    Create a Node.js client that allows you to interact with our REST API.
      ```tsx
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      });
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Start an auth session inside your endpoint</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    Every session should have a unique user ID, which is typically the ID of the user in your database.
      ```tsx highlight="10-13"
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      });

      export async function POST(request) {
        const user = { id: "olivier@example.com", info: { name: "Olivier" }};

        const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
          user.id,
          { userInfo: user.info } // Optional
        );
      }
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Give the user access to the room</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    Give if the current user access to the room, with either `session.FULL_ACCESS`, or `session.READ_ACCESS`.
      ```tsx highlight="15,16"
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      });

      export async function POST(request) {
        const user = { id: "olivier@example.com", info: { name: "Olivier" }};

        const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
          user.id,
          { userInfo: user.info } // Optional
        );

        const { room } = await request.json();
        session.allow(room, session.FULL_ACCESS);
      }
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Authorize the user and return the result</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    Give if the current user access to the room, with either `session.FULL_ACCESS`, or `session.READ_ACCESS`.
      ```tsx highlight="18,19"
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      });

      export async function POST(request) {
        const user = { id: "olivier@example.com", info: { name: "Olivier" }};

        const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
          user.id,
          { userInfo: user.info } // Optional
        );

        const { room } = await request.json();
        session.allow(room, session.FULL_ACCESS);

        const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
        return new Response(body, { status });
      }
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Point to the new endpoint</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    In the front end of your app, update your `liveblocks.config.ts` file to connect to the new endpoint.
    ```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="4"
      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

      const client = createClient({
        authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
      });
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>

<Step>
  <StepTitle>You’re migrated!</StepTitle>
  <StepContent>
    You’ve successfully migrated, and now have a similar authentication set up
    as before! However, there are other new features we can take advantage of.
  </StepContent>
</Step>

  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Bonus: Issue access to multiple rooms</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    With Liveblocks 1.2, you can also issue access to multiple rooms, or even use a prefix-based wildcard in the room name, enabling any amount of rooms! You can learn more about this in our [access token](/docs/authentication/access-token#permissions) guide.
      ```tsx highlight="15-18"
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      });

      export async function POST(request) {
        const user = { id: "olivier@example.com", info: { name: "Olivier" }};

        const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
          user.id,
          { userInfo: user.info } // Optional
        );

        const { room } = await request.json();
        session.allow(room, session.FULL_ACCESS);
        session.allow("my-room-*", session.READ_ACCESS);
        session.allow("my-other-room", session.READ_ACCESS);

        const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
        return new Response(body, { status });
      }
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>

</Steps>

### Learn more about access tokens

You can find guides for your specific framework and learn more about permissions
in our [access tokens authentication guides](/docs/authentication/access-token).

Here’s a full working example of access tokens in a Next.js endpoint.

```ts file="app/api/liveblocks-auth/route.ts" isCollapsed isCollapsable
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Create a client
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const user = __getUserFromDB__(request);

  // Start an auth session inside your endpoint
  const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
    user.id,
    { userInfo: user.metadata } // Optional
  );

  // Give the user access to the room
  const { room } = await request.json();
  if (room && __shouldUserHaveAccess__(user, room)) {
    // e.g. session.allow("my-room", ["room:write"])
    session.allow(room, session.FULL_ACCESS);
  }

  // Authorize the user and return the result
  const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

## ID tokens [#id-tokens]

Are you already using our REST API to assign fine-grained permissions to each
room, via [Create room](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms) or
[Update room](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId) APIs? If
so, ID tokens may work best for you.

ID tokens follow the analogy of a _membership card_. Anyone with that membership
card can try to enter a room, but your permissions will be checked at the door.
This approach to permissions is most powerful because it can be set up very
finely, but it comes at the cost of having to keep those permissions
programmatically in sync with Liveblocks. We recommend it for advanced use cases
only.

### Upgrading to ID tokens [#upgrade-to-id-tokens]

If you’ve already set up room permissions using our REST API, then this should
be easy!

First, let’s create a new endpoint in your back end, next to your existing
`/api/auth` endpoint. We recommend going with `/api/liveblocks-auth`.

All you have to do now is implement it as follows:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Create a client</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    Create a Node.js client that allows you to interact with our REST API.
      ```tsx
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      });
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Identify the user and return the result</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    Whichever `userId` (or `groupIds`) you pass will be used to check the permissions you configured in your Liveblocks account already.
      ```tsx highlight="10-15"
      import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

      const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
        secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      });

      export async function POST(request) {
        const user = { id: "olivier@example.com", info: { name: "Olivier" }};

        const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
          userId: user.id,
          groupIds, // Optional
        });

        return new Response(body, { status });
      }
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Point to the new endpoint</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    In the front end of your app, update your `liveblocks.config.ts` file to connect to the new endpoint.
    ```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="4"
      import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

      const client = createClient({
        authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
      });
      ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>

<Step>
  <StepTitle>You’re migrated!</StepTitle>
  <StepContent>You’ve successfully migrated to id tokens!</StepContent>
</Step>

  <Step lastStep>
    <StepTitle>Bonus: Use our REST API to handle permissions</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
    ID tokens use permissions set with our [REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints).
    For example, this is how you [create a room](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms),
    and give a user full access.

    ```ts highlight="6-8"
    fetch("https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        id: "my-room-name",
        defaultAccesses: [],
        usersAccesses: {
          "olivier@example.com": ["room:write"]
        }
      }),
    });
    ```
    </StepContent>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Learn more about ID tokens

You can find guides for your specific framework and learn more about permissions
in our [ID tokens authentication guides](/docs/authentication/id-token).

Here’s a full working example of ID tokens in a Next.js endpoint.

```ts file="app/api/liveblocks-auth/route.ts" isCollapsed isCollapsable
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Create a client
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const user = __getUserFromDB__(request);

  // Identify the user and return the result
  const { status, body } = await liveblocks.identifyUser({
    userId: user.id,
    groupIds, // Optional
  });

  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```
