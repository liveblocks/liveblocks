Notifications is the first Liveblocks product that works across multiple rooms,
and this has required us to introduce breaking changes to ensure a consistent
API for Comments and Notifications.

## How to upgrade? [#how]

You can upgrade to 1.10 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks
package you’re using, for example in a React app:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@latest @liveblocks/react@latest @liveblocks/react-ui@latest @liveblocks/node@latest
```

If you’re using any other Liveblocks packages make sure to update those too.

## All changes are for Comments and Notifications

If you’re not using Comments or Notifications, there are no breaking changes for
you! However, if you are using these, or intend to use them in future, keep
reading.

## Security

Users must see the notifications across multiple rooms when they open their
inbox. This is the first time we must expose an API not associated with a single
room. It forced us to introduce a minor breaking change in our authentication
mechanism. Using
[`useInboxNotifications`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useInboxNotifications)
will call your authentication endpoint without a `room`.

### createClient with callback

If you use `createClient` with `authEndpoint`
[as a callback](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientCallback),
`room` is now optional.

```typescript
const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: (room) => {
    // The `room` argument will be `undefined` if you're using `useInboxNotifications`
  },
});
```

## Comments resolver functions

Notifications needs to resolve users, as well as Comments, so we’ve lifted the
resolver functions from `createRoomContext` to `createClient`.

Before:

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="7-12"
// ❌ Before - Liveblocks 1.9
const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
});

const { RoomProvider } = createRoomContext({
  async resolveUsers({ userIds, roomId }) {
    // ...
  },
  async resolveMentionSuggestions({ text, roomId }) {
    // ...
  },
});
```

After:

```tsx file="liveblocks.config.ts" highlight="4-9"
// ✅ After - Liveblocks 1.10
const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/auth/liveblocks-auth",
  async resolveUsers({ userIds }) {
    // ...
  },
  async resolveMentionSuggestions({ text }) {
    // ...
  },
});

const { RoomProvider } = createRoomContext();
```

Because the resolvers are no longer room-based, you’ll notice that `roomId` is
no longer in the parameters.

### Resolver types

Because the resolvers have moved to the `client`, the `ResolveUsersArgs` and
`ResolveMentionSuggestionsArgs` types are now exported from `@liveblocks/client`
instead of `@liveblocks/react`.

```tsx highlight="5,11"
// ❌ Before - Liveblocks 1.9
import {
  ResolveUsersArgs,
  ResolveMentionSuggestionsArgs,
} from "@liveblocks/react";

// ✅ After - Liveblocks 1.10
import {
  ResolveUsersArgs,
  ResolveMentionSuggestionsArgs,
} from "@liveblocks/client";
```

Relatedly,
[`stringifyCommentBody`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#stringify-comment-body)’s
`CommentBodyResolveUsersArgs` no longer exists, and you should use
`ResolveUsersArgs` instead.

```tsx highlight="5,11"
// ❌ Before - Liveblocks 1.9
import { CommentBodyResolveUsersArgs } from "@liveblocks/node";

// ✅ After - Liveblocks 1.10
import { ResolveUsersArgs } from "@liveblocks/node";
```

## Comments CSS variables

Some `elevation` and `tooltip`
[CSS variables](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#CSS-variables) have been
removed:

- `--lb-tooltip-background`
- `--lb-tooltip-foreground`
- `--lb-tooltip-foreground-contrast`
- `--lb-elevation-background`
- `--lb-elevation-foreground`
- `--lb-elevation-foreground-contrast`

Because these no longer exist, we recommend using the basic `--lb-*` variables
directly on `.lb-elevation` or `.lb-tooltip `.

Before:

```css
/* ❌ Before - Liveblocks 1.9 */
:root {
  --lb-tooltip-foreground: white;
  --lb-elevation-background: red;
}
```

After:

```css
/* ✅ After - Liveblocks 1.10 */
.lb-tooltip {
  --lb-foreground: white;
}

.lb-elevation {
  --lb-background: red;
}
```

## Comments overrides

Comments overrides allows you to replace a string or node in default components,
with another that you’ve specified. Some overrides have been changed.

- `SELF` is now `USER_SELF`.
- `UNKNOWN_USER` is now `USER_UNKNOWN`.
- `COMMENT_REACTION_REMAINING` no longer exists, and you should use the
  `LIST_REMAINING_USERS` instead.
- `COMMENT_REACTION_TOOLTIP` is now `COMMENT_REACTION_LIST`, and its arguments
  have been changed to `(list, emoji, count)`.

Before:

```tsx highlight="4-7"
// ❌ Before - Liveblocks 1.9
<CommentsConfig
  overrides={{
    SELF: "you",
    UNKNOWN_USER: "Anon",
    COMMENT_REACTION_REMAINING: (others) => `${others} people`,
    COMMENT_REACTION_TOOLTIP: (emoji, list) => (
      <>
        {list} reacted with {emoji}
      </>
    ),
  }}
/>
```

After:

```tsx highlight="4-7"
// ✅ After - Liveblocks 1.10
<CommentsConfig
  overrides={{
    USER_SELF: "you",
    USER_UNKNOWN: "Anon",
    LIST_REMAINING_USERS: (others) => `${others} people`,
    COMMENT_REACTION_LIST: (list, emoji, count) => (
      <>
        {list} reacted with {emoji}
      </>
    ),
  }}
/>
```

When upgrading, remember that overrides can be applied both globally with
`<CommentsConfig>`, and per component, e.g. `<Composer>`. Learn more in the
[overrides API reference](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Overrides).
