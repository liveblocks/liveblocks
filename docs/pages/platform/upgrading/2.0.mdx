TODO

Non-breaking changes:

- Module augmentation + importable hooks
- Improve `InboxNotification` props types
- Allow typing `RoomInfo` via augmentation

Breaking changes:

- Rename `@liveblocks/react-comments` to `@liveblocks/react-ui` and
  `<CommentsConfig />` to `<LiveblocksUIConfig />` (codemod)
- Rename `@liveblocks/node`'s `RoomInfo` to `RoomData` (codemod)
- In `@liveblocks/node`, `client.getThread<MyMeta>()` no longer takes type params. Use global type augmentation instead.
- Removal of the deprecated APIs
- Yjs package changes
  - No longer has a default export, change:
    ```diff
    -import LiveblocksProvider from "@liveblocks/yjs";
    +import { LiveblocksYjsProvider } from "@liveblocks/yjs";
    ```

## Step-wise migration guide

I found the following order of mechanical changes to be most ideal path to
upgrade. You can make a Git commit after every one of these changes.

1. Start with a clean slate, run `tsc` to make sure your project contains no
   TypeScript errors to begin with.
1. Replace `@liveblocks/react-comments` by `@liveblocks/react-ui`:
   1. Run the codemod:
      `npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest react-comments-to-react-ui`
1. Upgrade _all_ `@liveblocks/*` packages to `@latest`:
   1. Run `npm i @liveblocks/client@latest @liveblocks/react@latest ...` for
      every package you have
1. Run `tsc` again, no new errors should pop up at this point. If they do, they
   should only be from APIs that were long-deprecated and now removed. Adjust
   accordingly. See section above.
1. [Mechanical change] Go to `liveblocks.config.ts`, look at the
   `createRoomContext()` call. Add the `declare global { ... }` definition right
   above it, and move the type params to the global. Remove the type params.
   [Example of this change](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/commit/da750d4ac9e88d812c0fb612ce18f02920d65463).
   And another
   [example](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/commit/1c14e6e553463538d722b0b91baacc2aa4ff3267).
1. [Mechanical change]
   1. If using `const { suspense: { ... } } = createRoomContext()`, do a mass
      search & replace of `"../../path/to/liveblocks.config"` to
      `"@liveblocks/react/suspense"`.
      [Examples of this change](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/commit/9e6fd25f21e1bcbc4e625161f8d33ce6aaafb0ab).
   1. If using `const { ... } = createRoomContext()`, do a mass search & replace
      of `"../../path/to/liveblocks.config"` to `"@liveblocks/react"`.
      [Example of this change](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/commit/adc5692b072ef291082c2e1a22e77eb30c2b1667).
1. Run `tsc` again. There should not be any TypeScript issues at this point.
   However, the code will not work.
1. [Mechanical change]
   1. Go to `liveblocks.config.ts`, look at the `createClient()` call.
   1. Copy its options, then remove the `createClient()` call and the `client`
      global instance.
   1. Find the module where you are importing `RoomProvider`.
   1. Around the existing `<RoomProvider>` instance (or higher up the component
      tree), wrap a new `<LiveblocksProvider /* options */>` around it. Pass all
      the copied client options in here as props.
   1. If you have other places in your components that are using the `client`
      instance directly, you can use the new `useClient()` hook to get it.
   1. [Example of this change](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/commit/414f83c655ec5c5b5e045ab970423fb2ef79c50f).
1. [Optional cleanup] At this point you are converted, but you can further
   simplify your types. Find all places where you're using `Presence`,
   `Storage`, etc as types, and remove them as type params from our Liveblocks
   types, like `User<MyPresence, MyUserMeta>` and just remove those.
   [Example of this change](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/commit/d079a0056a792c15c752dcd581ee9cc264269b81).
1. That's it! You're converted! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
