TODO

Non-breaking changes:

- Module augmentation + importable hooks
- Improve `InboxNotification` props types
- Allow typing `RoomInfo` via augmentation

Breaking changes:

- Rename `@liveblocks/react-comments` to `@liveblocks/react-ui` and
  `<CommentsConfig />` to `<LiveblocksUIConfig />` (codemod)
- Rename `@liveblocks/node`'s `RoomInfo` to `RoomData` (codemod)
- Removal of the deprecated APIs
- Maybe some Yjs package changes
