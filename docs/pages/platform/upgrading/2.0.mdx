---

Liveblocks 2.0 is our second major release, and focuses on removing any rough
edges and smoothening the developer experience. It makes Liveblocks simpler to
set up for new users as well as for existing users. Our long term goal is to
empower you to write and evolve your apps in the best way possible, and at
enterprise scale.

<Banner title="Just want to upgrade?">

Skip ahead to the [how to upgrade](#how-to-upgrade) section.

## Rationale

Liveblocks has always embraced the benefits of static typing with TypeScript.
Roughly two years ago, we published 0.17, which
[introduced](/blog/whats-new-in-v0-17) the pattern of calling
`createRoomContext()` and returning a “bundle” of type-safe hooks that you could
then use in your application. This pattern worked nicely because all the hooks
were bound to your custom type definitions for `Presence`, `Storage`, etc. in
one single place, and every Liveblocks API would deeply know about it. No need
for manual type annotations anywhere else in your codebase.

### Downsides to this approach

There were, however, a couple of downsides to this approach that have always
kept itching:

- Importing hooks from a local config file was a little bit awkward. It wasn’t
  an all too familiar pattern for most users.
- Re-exporting the list of hooks took maintenance. If we added a new hook, you’d
  have to also re-export it manually.
- Due to how TypeScript works, the type params you’d provide to
  `createRoomContext()` had a fixed ordering to them. If you wanted to specify
  only `Presence` and `RoomEvent`, you’d have to “skip” some type params, by
  doing `createRoomContext<Presence, {}, {}, RoomEvent>()` or similar.

### Introducing Liveblocks 2.0

With 2.0, this all becomes a lot simpler. We’ve done a lot of internal
refactoring to make this possible. We’ll dive in soon, but here is a sneak peek:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false} file="liveblocks.config.ts"
// ❌ This pattern is no longer recommended unless you need multiple room types
export const {
  suspense: { RoomProvider, useRoom, useThread },
} = createRoomContext<
  MyPresence,
  MyStorage,
  MyUserMeta,
  MyRoomEvent,
  MyThreadMetadata
>(client);

// ✅ After
declare global {
  // These custom types are all optional, just define the ones you want/need
  interface Liveblocks {
    Presence: MyPresence;
    Storage: MyStorage;
    UserMeta: MyUserMeta;
    RoomEvent: MyRoomEvent;
    ThreadMetadata: MyThreadMetadata;
  }
}
```

```tsx showLineNumbers={false} file="Component.tsx"
// ❌ Before
import { RoomProvider, useRoom, useThreads } from "./liveblocks.config.ts";

// ✅ After
import { RoomProvider, useRoom, useThreads } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";
// or
import { RoomProvider, useRoom, useThreads } from "@liveblocks/react";
```

We’ll first go over all the breaking changes, then we’ll show you how to
simplify your codebase.

## How to upgrade [#how-to-upgrade]

First of all, let’s upgrade all Liveblocks dependencies to their latest
versions. The easiest way to do that is to run the following command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --upgrade
```

There are also some **breaking changes** in this update. **Most users will not
run into any of these**, but there is a chance that some of these will affect
your situation. Making the necessary code adjustments should however be easy. In
many cases, we provide a codemod that makes the actual change for you, so you
don’t have to do so manually.

### Breaking change 1: renamed package [#bc1]

<Banner>

This breaking change only affects users of `@liveblocks/react-comments`.

</Banner>

We’ve renamed our package `@liveblocks/react-comments` to
`@liveblocks/react-ui`, because our library of pre-built UI components now
contains more than just Comments-related components. Please adjust your imports.

Run the following **codemod** or manually make the changes:

```bash
npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest react-comments-to-react-ui
```

This will change your imports like this:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
import { Thread } from "@liveblocks/react-comments";

// ✅ After
import { Thread } from "@liveblocks/react-ui";
```

And also:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
<CommentsConfig />

// ✅ After
<LiveblocksUIConfig />
```

### Breaking change 2: renamed exports in our Node package [#bc2]

<Banner>

This breaking change only affects users of `@liveblocks/node`.

</Banner>

To avoid confusion with the newly introduced custom
[`RoomInfo`](#New-custom-type-RoomInfo) type, we’ve renamed the `RoomInfo` type
in our `@liveblocks/node` package.

Run the following **codemod** or manually make the changes:

```bash
npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest room-info-to-room-data
```

This will change:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
import { RoomInfo } from "@liveblocks/node";
const rooms: RoomInfo[] = [];

// ✅ After
import { RoomData } from "@liveblocks/node";
const rooms: RoomData[] = [];
```

### Breaking change 3: client methods from our Node package no longer take type params [#bc3]

<Banner>

This breaking change only affects users of `@liveblocks/node`.

</Banner>

In `@liveblocks/node`, none of the client methods, like
`liveblocks.getThread()`, take type params any longer.

Make the following changes:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
await liveblocks.createThread<MyThreadMetadata>();
await liveblocks.editThreadMetadata<MyThreadMetadata>();
await liveblocks.getThreads<MyThreadMetadata>();
await liveblocks.getThread<MyThreadMetadata>();
//                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ No longer possible

// ✅ After
await liveblocks.createThread();
await liveblocks.editThreadMetadata();
await liveblocks.getThreads();
await liveblocks.getThread();

// In liveblocks.config.ts
declare global {
  interface Liveblocks {
    ThreadMetadata: MyThreadMetadata;
  }
}
```

You should use global type augmentation instead. Please see
[“Simplifying your Liveblocks application”](#simplifying) below for a lot more
detail on this transition.

### Breaking change 4: changed default export to named export in Yjs package [#bc4]

<Banner>

This breaking change only affects users of `@liveblocks/yjs`.

</Banner>

To make discoverability and refactorings easier, and to avoid confusion with the
newly introduced [`LiveblocksProvider`][] in our React package, we’re no longer
using default exports, but named exports only.

Run the following **codemod** or manually make the changes:

```bash
npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest remove-yjs-default-export
```

This will change your import (and its usage) like this:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
import LiveblocksProvider from "@liveblocks/yjs";
const yDoc = new Y.Doc();
const yProvider = new LiveblocksProvider(room, yDoc);
```

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ✅ After
import { LiveblocksYjsProvider } from "@liveblocks/yjs";
const yDoc = new Y.Doc();
const yProvider = new LiveblocksYjsProvider(room, yDoc);
```

### Breaking change 5: minor LiveList constructor change [#bc5]

<Banner>

This breaking change only affects users of Storage.

</Banner>

The `LiveList()` constructor’s argument is no longer optional, because it causes
unneeded but confusing type inference issues.

Run the following **codemod** or manually make the changes:

```bash
npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest live-list-constructor
```

This will add an array to empty `LiveList` constructors:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
const mylist = new LiveList();

// ✅ After
const mylist = new LiveList([]);
```

### Breaking change 6: new webhook event types [#bc6]

<Banner>

This breaking change only affects users of webhooks.

</Banner>

The webhook event `NotificationEvent`’s type can represent multiple kinds of
notifications: `"thread"`, `"textMention"`, and custom ones (e.g.
`"$myNotification"`).

If you were using properties only available on the `"thread"` kind (e.g.
`threadId`), you will need to first check for the kind of notification before
accessing them.

```ts showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
const threadId = event.data.threadId;

// ✅ After
if (event.data.kind === "thread") {
  const threadId = event.data.threadId;
}
```

### Breaking change 7: removed deprecated APIs [#bc7]

All of the following APIs have been removed in 2.0, as they were deprecated
multiple versions ago.

**Affecting `@liveblocks/client`:**

- `Client.enter()` has been replaced by `Client.enterRoom()`
- `Client.leave()` has been replaced by `Client.enterRoom()`, which returns a
  `leave` function
- Client option `fetchPolyfill`, `WebSocketPolyfill`, are replaced by
  `polyfills: { fetch, WebSocket }`
- Legacy option `shouldInitiallyConnect` is now renamed to `autoConnect`
- Legacy connection status APIs, e.g. `room.getConnectionState()` and
  `.subscribe("connection")`. You can use `.getStatus()` or
  `.subscribe("status")` instead.
- `user.isReadOnly` field is replaced by `!user.canWrite` (note the negation
  here)
- The `Others<P, U>` type. Please change to `readonly User<P, U>[]`.

**Affecting `@liveblocks/react`:**

- The `useMap`, `useList`, and `useObject` hooks. These have been deprecated
  since the release of 0.18 (more than two years ago). Please see
  [the 0.18 upgrade guide](/docs/platform/upgrading/0.18#Step-5a:-Replace-reads-with-useStorage)
  for tips on how to rewrite these hooks to `useStorage`.
- The second argument `options` to `createRoomContext(client, options)` has been
  removed. These options have been moved to the client.

**Affecting `@liveblocks/node`:**

- Remove legacy `authorize` method from `@liveblocks/node`. Please refer to
  [the 1.2 upgrade guide](/docs/platform/upgrading/1.2#how) to learn how to
  upgrade your auth endpoint.

**Affecting `@liveblocks/redux` and `@liveblocks/zustand`:**

- Legacy aliased exports in Zustand/Redux packages are removed

## Simplifying your Liveblocks application (optional) [#simplifying]

<Banner title="Optional, but recommended">

This section is optional, but highly recommended. You can do it now, or come
back to do it later.

</Banner>

If you have dealt with the breaking changes above, or concluded they they don’t
apply to your situation, we can go a step further and really simplify your
Liveblocks setup.

<Banner type="warning" title="Do you have multiple room types?">

If your Liveblocks application has multiple room types, and therefore you have
multiple Liveblocks config files—one for each room type—then you cannot switch
to a single global type definition. In that advanced case, the following
simplifications do not apply to you. We will keep supporting the
`createRoomContext` API for these advanced use cases, but no longer recommend it
for the more common case of having just a single room type.

</Banner>

### Step 1: Use the new global Liveblocks custom types [#step1]

Go to your `liveblocks.config.ts`, find your `createRoomContext()` call. Now
decide which codemod to run.

**Option 1: You are using Suspense hooks.**
(`const { suspense: { useRoom, ... } }`)

```bash
npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest remove-liveblocks-config-contexts --suspense
```

**Option 2: You are using classic hooks.** (`const { useRoom, ... }`)

```bash
npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest remove-liveblocks-config-contexts
```

Running either of these will make the following changes.

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
export const {
  ...
} = createRoomContext<MyPresence, MyStorage, MyUserMeta, MyRoomEvent, MyThreadMetadata>(client);
```

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ✅ After
declare global {
  interface Liveblocks {
    Presence: MyPresence;
    Storage: MyStorage;
    UserMeta: MyUserMeta;
    RoomEvent: MyRoomEvent;
    ThreadMetadata: MyThreadMetadata;
  }
}
```

Secondly, it will change all imports in your code base to import the hooks
directly instead:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
import { RoomProvider, useRoom, ... } from "./liveblocks.config.ts";
```

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ✅ After
import { RoomProvider, useRoom, ... } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";  // Option 1
import { RoomProvider, useRoom, ... } from "@liveblocks/react";           // Option 2
```

### Step 2: Set up a LiveblocksProvider [#step2]

At this point, there should not be any new TypeScript issues. However, running
the code will not yet work. This is because previously the hooks were bound to
the `client` instance by passing it to the `createRoomContext()` factory, which
we now removed. When using the global types, we’ll have to provide the
Liveblocks client otherwise.

The way to do it is to use a pretty standard React provider. Make the following
change:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false} file="liveblocks.config.ts"
// ❌ Before, you no longer have to use createClient()
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";

const client = createClient({
  authEndpoint: "/api/liveblocks-auth",
  throttle: 16,
  /* etc */
);
```

```tsx showLineNumbers={false} file="layout.tsx"
// ✅ After
"use client";

import { LiveblocksProvider } from "@liveblocks/react";

export function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    // Move options here, client will be created for you
    <LiveblocksProvider
      authEndpoint="/api/liveblocks-auth"
      throttle={16}
      /* etc */
    >
      {children}
    </LiveblocksProvider>
  );
}
```

<Banner type="info" title="Where to put this?">

We recommend placing the `LiveblocksProvider` as high up your component tree as
you can, preferably in your `_app.tsx` or `layout.tsx` (or equivalent for your
React framework of choice). Unfortunately, we cannot provide a codemod for this
step, because we cannot mechanically decide where exactly to inject the
Liveblocks provider in your application.

</Banner>

If you were exporting the `client` instance before and have components that
directly accessed it before, you can now obtain a reference to the `client`
instance that the `LiveblocksProvider` creates for you using the `useClient`
hook:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
import { client } from "./liveblocks.config";

function MyComponent() {
  doSomethingWith(client);
}
```

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ✅ After
import { useClient } from "@liveblocks/react"; // or
import { useClient } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";

function MyComponent() {
  const client = useClient();
  doSomethingWith(client);
}
```

### Step 3: Optional cleanup of type params [#step3]

If you also exported your `Presence`, `Storage`, etc types from
`liveblocks.config.ts` before, you no longer have to. The main reason to export
these before was to use them in helper functions that used some of the
Liveblocks types, like `User`, or `Room`.

```bash
npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest remove-unneeded-type-params
```

For example:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
import type { Room, User } from "@liveblocks/client";
import type { MyPresence, MyStorage } from "./liveblocks.config";

// ❌ Before
function isAdult(user: User<MyPresence, MyUserMeta>) {
  //                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  return user.info.age >= 18;
  //               ^^^ Coming from MyUserMeta
}

// ❌ Before
function doSomethingWithRoom(
  room: Room<MyPresence, MyStorage, MyUserMeta, never>
  //         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
) {
  /* ... */
}
```

This is no longer needed. You can simply remove them. TypeScript will still know
about your custom `age` property on `user.info`.

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
import type { Room, User } from "@liveblocks/client";

// ✅ After
function isAdult(user: User) {
  return user.info.age >= 18;
  //               ^^^ Still coming from configured UserMeta custom type
}

// ✅ After
function doSomethingWithRoom(room: Room) {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Improvements

Furthermore, the following miscellaneous quality-of-life improvements have been
made that are non-breaking changes.

### `ClientSideSuspense` no longer needs a function

Previously, the `ClientSideSuspense` helper needed a function as its `children`
prop, but it no longer has to.

```bash
npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest simplify-client-side-suspense-children
```

This will change:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
<ClientSideSuspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  {() => <MyApp />}
</ClientSideSuspense>
```

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ✅ After
<ClientSideSuspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <MyApp />
</ClientSideSuspense>
```

### Improved `InboxNotification` props types

When passing custom components to the `kinds` prop of [`InboxNotification`][],
you could use types like `InboxNotificationThreadProps` for the props. But this
wasn’t always true for all notification kinds, so now you can use types named
`InboxNotificationThreadKindProps` for your components, while
`InboxNotificationThreadProps` describes the props of our own
`InboxNotification.Thread`.

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ❌ Before
function MyThreadNotification(props: InboxNotificationThreadProps) {
  return <InboxNotification.Thread {...props} />;
}

<InboxNotification kinds={{ thread: MyThreadNotification }} />;
```

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
// ✅ After
function MyThreadNotification(props: InboxNotificationThreadKindProps) {
  //                                                        ^^^^
  return <InboxNotification.Thread {...props} />;
}

<InboxNotification kinds={{ thread: MyThreadNotification }} />;
```

### New custom type `RoomInfo`

By using the [`resolveRoomsInfo`][] callback from [`createClient`][] or the new
[`LiveblocksProvider`][], you can attach arbitrary room data to a room, which
you can retrieve with the [`useRoomInfo`][] hook.

Both of these APIs will now respect the type you provide via:

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
declare global {
  interface Liveblocks {
    RoomInfo: {
      /* your custom type definition here */
    };
  }
}
```

### New custom type `ActivitiesData`

By providing a custom `ActivitiesData` type, you can improve how your custom
notifications and their activities’ data are typed.

```tsx showLineNumbers={false}
declare global {
  interface Liveblocks {
    // Custom activities data for custom notification kinds
    ActivitiesData: {
      // Example, a custom $alert kind
      $alert: {
        title: string;
        message: string;
      };
    };

    // Other kinds
    // ...
  }
}
```

That’s it!
