There’s a small breaking changes in this update, as we’re introducing a better
API to enter and leave rooms. If you’re calling `client.enter()` or
`client.leave()` in your application, or using our Zustand or Redux packages, we
recommend you read on.

## How to upgrade? [#how]

You can upgrade to 1.5 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks
package you’re using, for example in a React app:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@latest @liveblocks/node@latest @liveblocks/react@latest
```

If you’re using any other Liveblocks packages make sure to update those too.

## Recommended: new enter/leave API

Until now, the API to manually enter a Room using the client looked like the
following:

```tsx
// ❌ We recommend you stop using this API
const room = client.enter("my-room", options);

// Then later, when unmounting
client.leave("my-room");
```

These APIs will remain supported and unchanged, but starting with Liveblocks
1.5, there is a new preferred API, which we recommend you switch to:

```tsx
// ✅ Prefer this API instead
const { room, leave } = client.enterRoom("my-room", options);

// Then later, when unmounting
leave();
```

We’ve changed this API to return a new “leave” function every time a room
reference is requested. This allows sharing the same room connection with two or
more parts of your application, without those parts competing for control of the
room connection. The room connection will only be terminated after every `leave`
function has been called.

This enables more advanced use cases such as supporting multiple `RoomProvider`
instances for the same room ID, in different parts of your application, or using
our React package for one part of your application, while using a Zustand store
for another.

## Upgrading for Zustand users

If you’re using our Zustand package, there’s a breaking change—you no longer
need to pass the room ID to leave the room:

```tsx
const {
  liveblocks: { leaveRoom },
} = useStore();

// ❌ Before
leaveRoom("my-room-name");

// ✅ After
leaveRoom();
```

## Upgrading for Redux users

If you’re using our Redux package, there’s a similar breaking change—you no
longer need to pass the room ID to leave the room:

```tsx
const dispatch = useDispatch();

// ❌ Before
dispatch(actions.leaveRoom("my-room-name"));

// ✅ After
dispatch(actions.leaveRoom());
```
