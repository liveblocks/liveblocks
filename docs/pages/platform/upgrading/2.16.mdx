We’ve made React changes, affecting how our error listener hook works, and how
undefined metadata is filtered in Comments.

## How to upgrade

Upgrade to 2.16 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks package
you’re using. The easiest way to do this is to run the following command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --upgrade
```

## Does this affect you? [#does-this-affect-you]

**If you’re using the [`useErrorListener`][] hook**, please read about
[a behavior change](#change-1).

**If you’re using Comments in React**, please read about
[the change to metadata filtering](#change-2).

Otherwise, no changes will affect you.

## New errors can appear in `useErrorListener` [#change-1]

From 2.16, [`useErrorListener`][] will notify you about new errors. Previously,
only room connection errors were previously reported, possible if you were using
Presence, Storage, or Yjs. After upgrading, you can also receive a number of
errors from Comments and Notifications.

```tsx
import { useErrorListener } from "@liveblocks/react";

useErrorListener((error) => {
  switch (error.context.type) {
    // +++
    case "CREATE_THREAD_ERROR":
      const { roomId, threadId, commentId, body, metadata } = error.context;
      break;
    // +++

    // +++
    case "MARK_INBOX_NOTIFICATION_AS_READ_ERROR":
      const { inboxNotificationId, roomId } = error.context;
      break;
    // +++

    // Many other new errors
    // ...
  }
});
```

For a full list of possible errors, see the [`useErrorListener`][]
documentation.

We have also decoupled [`useErrorListener`][] from the current room. Previously
it required to be nested under a
[`RoomProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RoomProvider). Now, you
can use it anywhere under
[`LiveblocksProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProvider),
and it will notify you about errors from all rooms.

### To upgrade [#upgrade-change-1]

No changes are necessary to upgrade, however **if you would like to keep the old
behavior** and only show room connection errors, you can filter out all new
errors with an early return:

```ts
import { useErrorListener, useRoom } from "@liveblocks/react";

function App() {
  // +++
  const room = useRoom();
  // +++

  useErrorListener((error) => {
    // +++
    if (
      error.context.roomId !== room.id &&
      error.context.type !== "ROOM_CONNECTION_ERROR"
    ) {
      return;
    }
    // +++

    // Your previous logic
  });
}
```

## Ability to filter threads by absence of metadata [#change-2]

From 2.16, the [`useThreads`][] (and `useUserThreads_experimental`) hooks
supports filtering by _absence_ of a metadata field using `null`.

```ts
// ✅ Will now return "important" threads without a `color` field
const threads = useThreads({
  query: {
    metadata: {
      // +++
      color: null,
      // +++
      label: "important",
    },
  },
});
```

Previously this was not supported, but due to a bug, using an explicit
`undefined` would already allow you to do this. However, threads weren’t
filtered correctly in our back end causing over-fetches.

### To upgrade [#upgrade-change-2]

If you relied on this bug, change `undefined` to `null` in any metadata
properties. **This will keep behavior the same**—if you don’t make this change,
then your previous filtering will no longer work.

```ts title="Before"
const threads = useThreads({
  query: {
    metadata: {
      // ❌ Before - Will have no effect in 2.16
      // +++
      color: undefined,
      // +++
      label: "important",
    },
  },
});
```

```ts title="After"
const threads = useThreads({
  query: {
    metadata: {
      // ✅ After - Will now find threads without a `color`
      // +++
      color: null,
      // +++
      label: "important",
    },
  },
});
```

That’s it for 2.16!
