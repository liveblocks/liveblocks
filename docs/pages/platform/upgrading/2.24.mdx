We’ve renamed some of the concepts around notifications and notification
settings to improve clarity.

## How to upgrade

Upgrade to 2.24 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks package
you’re using. The easiest way to do this is to run the following command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --upgrade
```

## Does this affect you? [#does-this-affect-you]

If you are using notification settings in any way—with [`@liveblocks/client`][],
[`@liveblocks/react`][], [`@liveblocks/node`][], or
[the REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints)—continue reading to see
the changes. The naming changes are **backwards compatible**.

Otherwise, no changes will affect you.

## Naming changes

### Rationale

Historically, we used the term “notification settings” to refer to
**room-level** settings that control the
[inbox notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/concepts#Inbox-Notifications)
received by a user (e.g. setting `"threads"` to `"all"` would make the user
receive inbox notifications for any threads activity in the room, not just the
ones where they participate).

With 2.18, we introduced the concept of “**user** notification settings”, which
are **project-level** settings that control the notifications (
[`"notification"` webhook events](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent),
not "inbox notifications") received by a user (e.g. setting
`email.$myCustomNotification` to `false` would disable `"notification"` webhook
events for the `$myCustomNotification` kind and the `email` channel).

To improve clarity, we’re renaming these concepts:

- “room **notification** settings” → “room **subscription** settings”: they
  control which things a user is subscribed to in a room
- “**user** notification settings” → “notification settings”: they control which
  notifications a user receives

### What changed

All methods, hooks, types, and REST API endpoints that were using these terms
have been renamed to use the new naming, see the examples below.

We provide a codemod to automatically update your codebase to the new naming.

```bash
npx @liveblocks/codemod@latest rename-notification-settings
```

#### `@liveblocks/react`

```tsx
// ❌ Before
import {
  // +++
  useRoomNotificationSettings,
  useUpdateRoomNotificationSettings,
  // +++
} from "@liveblocks/react";

// ✅ After
import {
  // +++
  useRoomSubscriptionSettings,
  useUpdateRoomSubscriptionSettings,
  // +++
} from "@liveblocks/react";
```

```tsx
// ❌ Before
useErrorListener((error) =>
  // +++
  if (error.context.type === "UPDATE_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_ERROR") {
    // +++
    /* ... */
  }
);

// ✅ After
useErrorListener((error) =>
  // +++
  if (error.context.type === "UPDATE_ROOM_SUBSCRIPTION_SETTINGS_ERROR") {
    // +++
    /* ... */
  }
);
```

#### `@liveblocks/client`

```tsx
// ❌ Before
import type { RoomNotificationSettings } from "@liveblocks/client";

// ✅ After
import type { RoomSubscriptionSettings } from "@liveblocks/client";
```

```tsx
// ❌ Before
const { room, leave } = client.enterRoom("my-room-id");

// +++
room.getNotificationSettings();
room.updateNotificationSettings(/* ... */);
// +++

// ✅ After
const { room, leave } = client.enterRoom("my-room-id");

// +++
room.getSubscriptionSettings();
room.updateSubscriptionSettings(/* ... */);
// +++
```

```tsx
// ❌ Before
import type { UserNotificationSettings } from "@liveblocks/client";

// ✅ After
import type { NotificationSettings } from "@liveblocks/client";
```

#### `@liveblocks/node`

```tsx
// ❌ Before
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});

// +++
await liveblocks.getRoomNotificationSettings(/* ... */);
await liveblocks.updateRoomNotificationSettings(/* ... */);
await liveblocks.deleteRoomNotificationSettings(/* ... */);
// +++

// ✅ After
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});

// +++
await liveblocks.getRoomSubscriptionSettings(/* ... */);
await liveblocks.updateRoomSubscriptionSettings(/* ... */);
await liveblocks.deleteRoomSubscriptionSettings(/* ... */);
// +++
```

#### REST API

```shell
# ❌ Before
https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/:roomId/users/:userId/notification-settings

# ✅ After
https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/:roomId/users/:userId/subscription-settings
```

That’s it for 2.24!
