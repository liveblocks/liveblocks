<Banner>
  The Management API is currently in private beta for Enterprise customers.
  Reach out to [sales@liveblocks.io](mailto:sales@liveblocks.io) to enable it on
  your team.
</Banner>

The Liveblocks Management API allows you to interact programmatically with your
Liveblocks' projects and webhooks. With the API, you can create, update, and
delete projects, webhooks, and more.

The Liveblocks Management API is organized around REST. The API has predictable
resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns
JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication,
and verbs. See the [API reference](api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#Management)
for more information.

```
https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/management
```

## How it works

When Management API is enabled, you'll need to authenticate your requests using
an access token. This access token is generated from your Liveblocks team and
can be found in the [dashboard](/dashboard/team-settings) teams settings page
under the **Management API** section.

## Generating an access token

<Banner>
  Management API access tokens are team-linked and can only be created by team
  owners. If you don't have team owner permissions, contact your team owner to
  generate a token for you.
</Banner>

To generate a new Management API access token click the **+ Generate new
token...** button to open the token generation dialog.

<Figure>
  <Image

    alt="Generate new access token dialog"
    width={768}
    height={406}
  />
</Figure>

In the dialog, you'll need to provide a name for your token. The token name
helps you identify and manage multiple tokens later. Next, select the scopes
that define what permissions your token will have:

- **Read**: Allows viewing data but not modifying it. Grants read access to all
  resources.
- **Write**: Allows creating, modifying, and deleting data. Grants write access
  to all resources.

You can select one or both scopes depending on your needs. Once you've
configured your token name and scopes, click **Generate new token** to create
it.

  More granular scopes will be available in a future update. If you'd like to
  provide feedback or have specific scope requirements, please contact
  [sales@liveblocks.io](mailto:sales@liveblocks.io).
</Banner>

After generation, a dialog will appear displaying your new Management API token.
This is the **only time** you'll be able to view and copy the full token value.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/management-api/new-access-token-dialog.png"
    alt="New access token dialog"
    width={768}
    height={406}
  />
</Figure>

**Important:** Save and store this token in a secure place, such as a password
manager or secret store. You won't be able to see it again after closing this
dialog. Use the copy icon in the dialog to copy the token to your clipboard
before clicking **Done**.

After you close the dialog, your new token will appear in the Management API
tokens list. The token value will be partially obscured for security, showing
only the first few characters. You can delete any token at any time using the
delete icon next to it.

## Access tokens expiry

All Management API access tokens expire after one year from the date of
generation. The expiration date is displayed when you generate a new token, and
you can view it for existing tokens in the Management API tokens list.

<Banner title="Upcoming">
  Custom expiration dates will be available in a future update. If you'd like to
  provide feedback or have specific scope requirements, please contact
  [sales@liveblocks.io](mailto:sales@liveblocks.io).
</Banner>

When a token expires, you'll need to generate a new token to continue using the
Management API. Make sure to rotate your tokens before they expire to avoid
interruptions in your API access.

## Revoking an access token

If you need to revoke a Management API access token, click the delete icon next
to the token in the Management API tokens list. A confirmation dialog will
appear asking you to confirm the revocation.

    alt="Revoke access token confirmation dialog"
    width={768}

  />
</Figure>

<Banner type="warning">
  Revoking a token will immediately block Management API access for any
  application or script using it. This may break integrations that depend on the
  token. **This action cannot be undone.** Once revoked, you cannot restore the
  token and will need to generate a new one if you need to restore access.
</Banner>

Before revoking a token, make sure to:

- Verify that no active integrations or scripts are using the token
- Generate a replacement token if needed, and update your integrations to use
  the new token
- Confirm that revoking the token won't disrupt critical operations

If you're certain you want to proceed, click **Yes I understand, revoke token**
in the confirmation dialog. The token will be immediately revoked and removed
from your tokens list.

## Usage

The Management API can be called from any terminals or in CI/CI pipelines using
the `curl` command.

```bash highlight="2-3"
# >_ terminal
curl -X GET "https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/management/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lbs_*******************" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```yaml highlight="9-10"
# >_ CI/CD workflow
name: Liveblocks Management API
jobs:
  projects:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: List all projects with the Management API
        run: |
          curl -X GET "https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/management/projects" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer lbs_*******************" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Rate limiting

The Management API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and system
stability. By default, each Management API access token (MAAT) is limited to
**1,000 requests per 60 seconds**.

This limit applies cumulatively across all requests made with a single access
token. If you exceed this limit, all API calls using that token will be blocked
for the next minute, and the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP
status response.

Rate limits are subject to our fair use policy. If you need higher rate limits
for your use case, please contact
[sales@liveblocks.io](mailto:sales@liveblocks.io) to discuss your requirements.
