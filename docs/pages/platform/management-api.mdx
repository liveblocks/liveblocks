  The Management API is currently in private beta for Enterprise customers.
  Reach out to [sales@liveblocks.io](mailto:sales@liveblocks.io) to enable it on
  your account.
</Banner>

The Liveblocks Management API allows you to interact programmatically with your
Liveblocks projects and webhooks. With the API, you can create, update, and
delete projects, webhooks, and more.

The Liveblocks Management API is organized around REST. The API has predictable
resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns
JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication,
and verbs. See the [API reference](api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#Management)
for more information.

```
https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/management
```

## How it works

When Management API is enabled, you'll need to authenticate your requests using
an access token. This access token is generated from your Liveblocks account and
can be found in the [dashboard](/dashboard/team-settings) teams settings page
under the **Management API** section.

## Generating an access token

To generate a new Management API access token click the “**Generate new
token…**” button to open the token generation dialog.

    alt="Generate new access token dialog"
    width={768}
    height={406}
  />
</Figure>

In the dialog, some options are available.

### Token name

A name for your token, which is used to help you identify and manage your
tokens.

```text title="Token name"
LB-MANAGEMENT-API-ACCESS-TOKEN
```

### Scopes

Scopes that define your token's permissions. You can select one or both scopes
depending on your needs.

- **Read**: Allows viewing data but not modifying it. Grants read access to all
  resources.
- **Write**: Allows creating, modifying, and deleting data. Grants write access
  to all resources.

```text title="Scopes"
✔︎ Read
✔︎ Write
```

  More granular scopes will be available in a future update.

### Generate new token

Once you've configured your token name and scopes, click **Generate new token**
to create it. After generation, a dialog will appear displaying your new
Management API token. This is the **only time** you'll be able to view and copy
the full token value.

<Figure>

    alt="New access token dialog"
    width={768}
    height={406}
  />
</Figure>

**Save and store this token in a secure place**, such as a password manager or
secret store. You won't be able to see it again after closing this dialog. Use
the copy icon in the dialog to copy the token to your clipboard before clicking
“**Done**”.

After you close the dialog, your new token will appear in the Management API
tokens list. The token value will be partially obscured for security, showing
only the first few characters. You can delete any token at any time using the
delete icon next to it.

## Access tokens expiry

All Management API access tokens expire after one year from the date of
generation. The expiration date is displayed when you generate a new token, and
you can view it for existing tokens in the Management API tokens list.

When a token expires, you'll need to generate a new token to continue using the
Management API. Make sure to rotate your tokens before they expire to avoid
interruptions in your API access.

  Custom expiration dates will be available in a future update.

## Revoking an access token

If you need to revoke a Management API access token, click the delete icon next
to the token in the Management API tokens list. A confirmation dialog will
appear asking you to confirm the revocation.

    alt="Revoke access token confirmation dialog"
    width={768}

  />
</Figure>

<Banner title="This action cannot be undone" type="warning">
  Revoking a token will immediately block Management API access for any
  application or script using it. This may break integrations that depend on the
  token. Once revoked, you cannot restore the token and will need to generate a
  new one if you need to restore access.
</Banner>

Before revoking a token, make sure to:

- Verify that no active integrations or scripts are using the token
- Generate a replacement token if needed, and update your integrations to use
  the new token
- Confirm that revoking the token won't disrupt critical operations

If you're certain you want to proceed, click “**Yes I understand, revoke
token**” in the confirmation dialog. The token will be immediately revoked and
removed from your tokens list.

## Usage

The Management API can be called from any terminals or in CI/CI pipelines using
the `curl` command. Pass your management token, e.g. `lbs_sd7H24...`, in the
`Authorization` header.

```bash highlight="2-3"
# >_ terminal
curl -X GET "https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/management/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lbs_*******************" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```yaml highlight="9-10"
# >_ CI/CD workflow
name: Liveblocks Management API
jobs:
  projects:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: List all projects with the Management API
        run: |
          curl -X GET "https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/management/projects" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer lbs_*******************" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
