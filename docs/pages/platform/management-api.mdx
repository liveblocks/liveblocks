The Liveblocks Management API allows you to interact programmatically with your
Liveblocks' projects and webhooks. With the API, you can create, update, and
delete projects, webhooks, and more.

The Liveblocks Management API is organized around REST. The API has predictable
resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns
JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication,
and verbs. See the [API reference](api-reference/rest-api-endpoints) for more
information.
