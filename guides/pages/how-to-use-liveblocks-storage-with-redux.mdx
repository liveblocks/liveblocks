In this guide, we’ll be learning how to use Liveblocks Storage with Redux using
the APIs from the [`@liveblocks/redux`][] package.

This guide assumes you already have Liveblocks set up into your Redux store. If
you don’t make sure to follow
[these quick steps to get started](/docs/get-started/redux) first.

## Sync and persist the state across client [#storage-intro]

As opposed to `presence`, some collaborative features require that every user
interacts with the same piece of state. For example, in Google Docs, it is the
paragraphs, headings, images in the document. In Figma, it’s all the shapes that
make your design. That’s what we call the room’s `storage`.

Try the [Liveblocks DevTools extension](/devtools) to inspect and debug your
collaborative experiences as you build them, in real-time.

The room’s storage is a conflicts-free state that multiple users can edit at the
same time. It is persisted to our backend even after everyone leaves the room.
Liveblocks provides custom data structures inspired by
[CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) that
can be nested to create the state that you want.

- [`LiveObject`][] - Similar to JavaScript object. If multiple users update the
  same property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
  servers is the winner.
- [`LiveList`][] - An ordered collection of items synchronized across clients.
  Even if multiple users add/remove/move elements simultaneously, LiveList will
  solve the conflicts to ensure everyone sees the same collection of items.
- [`LiveMap`][] - Similar to a JavaScript Map. If multiple users update the same
  property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
  servers is the winner.

When using our Redux integration you cannot interact directly with these data
structures. Our enhancer synchronizes your store with our data structures based
on the `storageMapping` configuration.

Here is an example to explain how it works under the hood. Imagine you have the
following store:

```js
/* ...client setup... */

const initialState = {
  firstName: "Marie",
  lastName: "Curie",
  discoveries: ["Polonium", "Radium"],
};

const slice = createSlice({
  name: "state",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setFirstName: (state, action) => {
      state.firstName = action.payload;
    },
    setLastName: (state, action) => {
      state.lastName = action.payload;
    },
    addDiscovery: (state, action) => {
      state.discoveries.push(action.payload);
    },
  },
});

export const { setScientist } = slice.actions;

function makeStore() {
  return configureStore({
    reducer: slice.reducer,
    enhancers: [
      enhancer({
        client,
        storageMapping: { firstName: true, lastName: true, discoveries: true },
      }),
    ],
  });
}

const store = makeStore();
```

With this setup, the room's `storage` root is :

```js
const root = new LiveObject({
  firstName: "Marie",
  lastName: "Curie",
  discoveries: new LiveList(["Polonium", "Radium"]),
});
```

If you update your store by dispatching `setFirstName("Pierre")`, the enhancer
will do `root.set("firstName", "Pierre")` for you and update the store of all
the users currently connected to the room. The enhancer compares the previous
state and the new state to detect changes and patch our data structures
accordingly.

The reverse process happens when receiving updates from other clients; the
enhancer patches your immutable state.

When entering a room with `enterRoom`, the enhancer fetches the room's storage
from our server and patches your store. If this is the first time you're
entering a room, the storage will be empty. `enterRoom` takes an additional
argument to initialize the room's storage.

```js
enterRoom("room-id", {
  firstName: "Lise",
  lastName: "Meitner",
  discoveries: ["Nuclear fission", "Protactinium"],
});
```
