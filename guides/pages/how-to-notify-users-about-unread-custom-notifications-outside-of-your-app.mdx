    "How to notify users about unread custom notifications outside of your app"

    "Learn how to trigger custom notifications externally, such as in Slack,
    Microsoft Teams, and more."
---

Liveblocks [Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications) allows you
to build a notification inbox, and send custom notifications to your users. With
our webhooks and REST API, it’s possible to fetch unread
[custom notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/concepts#Custom-notifications)
and send external notifications via email, in Slack, in Microsoft Teams, or in
any other service with an API, using webhooks. Notifications can also be
displayed in your app using
[`useInboxNotifications`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useInboxNotifications)
and the
[`InboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#InboxNotification)
component.

## What we’re building

In this guide we’ll be learning how to notify users about unread custom
notifications outside of your app, and more specifically, we’ll be looking at
how to:

- Trigger events based on unread custom notifications using the
  [`NotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent) webhook
  event.
- Fetch unread notifications using the
  [`@liveblocks/node`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) package.

This guide assumes you already have a Liveblocks Notifications project set up.
If you don’t have one yet, you can
[get started with Notifications](/docs/get-started/notifications), and come back
after you’re set up.

## What are inbox notifications?

Liveblocks uses the concept of inbox notifications, which differ to external
notifications. Inbox notifications are displayed within in-app inboxes, group
multiple activities together, and can change over time. These activities are
useful for sending status updates, for example seeing “Pending…” or “Complete…”
statuses in a file upload notification.

External notifications, such as Slack, and Microsoft Teams, are different, and
Liveblocks is set up to send them in a way that won’t overload your users with
notifications. This means that Liveblocks will wait to trigger these
notifications until a certain amount of time has passed, and will only trigger
them if your users has not read the notification on the front-end, which we
automatically keep track of.

Learn more about Notifications in the
[concepts page](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/concepts).

## Using webhooks

Liveblocks provides a number of [webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks) that can
send requests to your API endpoint when certain events occurs. One webhook we
provide is the [`NotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent)
webhook, which is triggered for each participating user in a thread, and can be
used to send external notifications to your users.

The information it returns allows you to retrieve the data attached to the
custom notification. Let’s take a look at how to set this up.

### Notification channels

You can send notifications via different channels, such as email, Slack,
Microsoft Teams, and Web Push. In our dashboard, you can enable notifications on
certain channels, and in this guide, we’ll be enabling a custom `$fileUploaded`
[notification kind](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications/concepts#Notification-kinds)
on the Slack channel. You must always enable the correct channel to ensure your
[`NotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent) webhook events
are triggered, and this guide will take you through setting it up.

<Banner title="Which notification channel?">

All channels currently work the same way, apart from in-app, but we suggest
selecting the service you’re setting up, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, so
it’s easy to tell which you’ve implemented.

## Create an endpoint in your project

When a webhook event is triggered, it can send a POST request to the back end in
your project. In this guide, we’ll be using a Next.js route handler (API
endpoint) as an example, but other frameworks work similarly.

In order to use webhooks, we’ll need to retrieve the `headers` and `body` from
the request. Here’s the basic endpoint we’ll be starting from:

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Handle webhooks and notifications
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

Create this endpoint in your project, and make it available on `localhost` at
the following URL:

```
/api/liveblocks-notifications
```

Make a note of this endpoint URL, as you’ll be using it later.

### Testing webhooks locally

Running webhooks locally can be difficult, but one way to do this is to use a
tool such as [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) or
[`ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) which allow you to temporarily
put your localhost server online.

If your project is running on `localhost:3000`, you can run the following
command to generate a temporary URL that’s available while your localhost server
is running:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

`localtunnel` generates a base URL that can be placed into the Liveblocks
webhooks dashboard for quick testing. To use this, take the full address of your
webhook endpoint, and replace the domain in your `localhost` address with the
generated URL.

```shell
# Take your local URL
http://localhost:3000/api/liveblocks-notifications

# Replace localhost with the generated domain, then copy it
https://my-localtunnel-url.loca.lt/api/liveblocks-notifications
```

You now have a URL that can be used in the webhooks dashboard.

## Set up webhooks on the Liveblocks dashboard

To use webhooks, you need to pass your endpoint URL to the webhooks dashboard
inside your Liveblocks project, and tell the webhook to trigger when a comment
has been created.

      If your app, make sure you’re sending a custom notification with
      [`triggerInboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-inbox-notifications-trigger).
      In our example, we’re sending a `$fileUploaded` notification.

      ```ts

## Verify the webhook request

The [`@liveblocks/node`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) package provides
you with a function that verifies whether the current request is a real webhook
request from Liveblocks. You can set this up by setting up a
[`WebhookHandler`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#WebhookHandler) and
running [`verifyRequest`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#verifyRequest).

Make sure to add your _webhook_ secret key from earlier—in a real project we’d
recommend using an environment variable for this.

```ts highlight="1,3-5,11-21"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // Send external notification
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Check the event and notification permissions

After verifying the request, we can then check we’re receiving the correct type
of event, on the correct channel. There are different `notification` events, and
in this case we’d like to check for a
[custom notification](/docs/platform/webhooks#Custom-notification) with the
`$fileUploaded` kind, as we’re specifically listening for this. We can do this
with `event.data.kind`, also making sure to check for the `slack` channel.

```ts
import { WebhookHandler, isCustomNotificationEvent } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // +++
  // When a $fileUploaded notification has been created on the slack channel
  if (event.data.kind === "$fileUploaded" && event.data.channel === "slack") {
    const { inboxNotificationId, userId } = event.data;

    // Send external notification
    // ...
  }
  // +++

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

Note that Liveblocks doesn’t have knowledge of your permissions system on the
back end, so it’s your responsibility to check if this user should have access
to the notification.

## Get custom notification data

The next step is to use the
[Liveblocks client](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#Liveblocks-client) from
`@liveblocks/node` to retrieve the inbox notification, and the corresponding
data set with
[`triggerInboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-inbox-notifications-trigger).
To do this we’ll need to add our project’s secret key from
[the dashboard](/dashboard/api-keys) to the Liveblocks client (_not_ the webhook
secret key we used earlier), before awaiting the
[`getInboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-users-userId-inboxNotifications-inboxNotificationId)
fucntion.

```ts
import {
  // +++
  Liveblocks,
  // +++
  WebhookHandler,
  isCustomNotificationEvent,
} from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
// +++
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });
// +++

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When a $fileUploaded notification has been created on the slack channel
  if (event.data.kind === "$fileUploaded" && event.data.channel === "slack") {
    const { inboxNotificationId, userId } = event.data;

    // +++
    try {
      // Get thread and notification
      const inboxNotification = await liveblocks.getInboxNotification({
        inboxNotificationId,
        userId,
      });

      // The custom data we set with `triggerInboxNotification`: `status` and `file`
      const { status, file } = inboxNotification.activities[0];

      // Send external notification
      // ...
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return new Response("Could not fetch notification data", { status: 500 });
    }
    // +++
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Send external notifications

Now that the custom notification has been retrieved, we can send the external
notifications. In this example, we’re sending a message to an incoming webhook
in Slack.

```ts
import {
  Liveblocks,
  WebhookHandler,
  isCustomNotificationEvent,
} from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When a $fileUploaded notification has been created on the slack channel
  if (event.data.kind === "$fileUploaded" && event.data.channel === "slack") {
    const { inboxNotificationId, userId } = event.data;

    try {
      // Get thread and notification
      const inboxNotification = await liveblocks.getInboxNotification({
        inboxNotificationId,
        userId,
      });

      // The custom data we set with `triggerInboxNotification`: `status` and `file`
      const { status, file } = inboxNotification.activities[0];

      // Send your external notification, e.g. to Slack
      // +++
      await fetch(
        "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        {
          method: "POST",
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            text: `A new file has been uploaded by ${userId}: ${file}`,
            username: `File Upload Bot`,
          }),
        }
      );
      // +++
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return new Response("Could not fetch notification data", { status: 500 });
    }
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

We’ve now successfully sent an external notification to a user!

## Allow users to toggle notifications

Using Liveblocks hooks and methods, it’s possible to create a notifications
settings interface, allowing end users to choose which notifications they’d like
to receive, and on which channels, saving their preferences.
