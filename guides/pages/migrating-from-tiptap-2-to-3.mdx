---

Tiptap v3 is a major update with breaking changes, but the migration process is
quite simple. This guide will help you upgrade your Liveblocks project that uses
Tiptap from version 2 to version 3.

<Banner title="Liveblocks 3.10.0+ requires Tiptap 3" type="warning">

Any Liveblocks version after 3.10.0 requires Tiptap 3. If you're upgrading
Liveblocks to version 3.10.0 or higher, you'll need to upgrade Tiptap to version
3 as well.

## Upgrade dependencies

First, upgrade all Tiptap and Liveblocks packages together to ensure
compatibility. Run this command to upgrade all necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @tiptap/react@3 @tiptap/starter-kit@3 @liveblocks/client@latest @liveblocks/react@latest @liveblocks/react-ui@latest @liveblocks/react-tiptap@latest
```

This will ensure that all packages are compatible with each other and prevent
version conflicts.

## Critical changes for Liveblocks users

While Tiptap 3 includes many changes, there are two particularly critical
changes that affect Liveblocks integration:

### 1. StarterKit configuration change

Liveblocks provides its own undo/redo functionality for collaborative editing.
In Tiptap 2, you disabled this by setting `history: false` in the StarterKit
extension. In Tiptap 3, this option has been renamed to `undoRedo`:

```tsx highlight="3-5"
const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({
      undoRedo: false, // Previously: history: false
    }),
    // Other extensions...
  ],
});
```

### 2. Set `immediatelyRender: false` for SSR

If you're using server-side rendering (such as with Next.js), it's now more
critical to set `immediatelyRender: false` in your editor configuration to
prevent hydration issues:

```tsx highlight="3"
const editor = useEditor(
  {
    immediatelyRender: false,
    extensions: [
      StarterKit.configure({
        undoRedo: false,
      }),
      // Other extensions...
    ],
  },
  []
);
```

This ensures the editor doesn't render on the server, which can cause mismatches
between server and client rendering.

## Style Changes

If you have your own styles for collaboration cursors, the default CSS classes
prefix changed from `.collaboration-cursor ` to `.collaboration-carets`.

```CSS
.collaboration-carets__caret,
.collaboration-cursor__caret {
}
.collaboration-carets__label,
.collaboration-cursor__label {
}
```
