    "Learn how to filter for certain threads using their metadata with our REST
    API"
---

When using Comments and retrieving threads with our REST API, it’s possible to
filter for specific threads using
[custom metadata](/docs/products/comments/metadata) and our custom query
language. This enables the
[Get Threads REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-threads)
to have filtering that works the same as with
[`useThreads`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useThreads) and
[`liveblocks.getThreads`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms-roomId-threads).

## Query language

You can filter threads by their metadata, allowing you to select for certain
properties, values, or even for string prefixes. Filters can be combined
together using `AND` logic.

### Cheatsheet

```js
// Threads with { status: 'open' } string metadata
metadata['status']:'open'

// Threads with `{ org }` string metadata that starts with "liveblocks:"
metadata['org']^'liveblocks:'

// Threads with { priority: 3 } number metadata
metadata['priority']:3

// Threads with { resolved: false } boolean metadata
metadata['resolved']:false

// Threads that do NOT have { status: 'closed' } string metadata
-metadata['status']:'closed'

// Threads that with `{ org }` string metadata that does NOT start with "acme:"
-metadata['org']^'acme:'

// Threads that do NOT have { priority: 1 } number metadata
-metadata['priority']:1

// Threads that do NOT have { resolved: true } boolean metadata
-metadata['resolved']:true

// Combine queries with AND
metadata['status']:'open' AND metadata['priority']:3

// A more complex combination
metadata['status']:'closed' AND -metadata['priority']:1 AND metadata['org']^'liveblocks:'
```

The `AND` is optional and can actually be omitted, but we’re using it here for
clarity.

### How to use

To use the query language with the
[REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-threads) pass
your query string to the `query` parameter, for example:

```
https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/{roomId}/threads?query=metadata['status']
```

To learn more on _setting_ custom metadata on threads, make sure to
[read our guide](/docs/products/comments/metadata).
