Sometimes it’s helpful to [reauthenticate](/docs/authentication) users, for
example after a logged out user has signed into your application, and you wish
to display their details.

## How to reauthenticate

By calling
[`room.reconnect`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Room.reconnect) you can
reconnect and reauthenticate your collaborative application without refreshing
the page or unmounting the
[`RoomProvider`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#RoomProvider) component.
Using this method will preserve the current client’s state, such as the
undo/redo history.

```ts highlight="5"
const { room, leave } = client.enterRoom("my-room", {
  // ...
});

room.reconnect();
```

### In React

In our React package, you can retrieve the current room with the
[`useRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useRoom) hook, before calling
`room.reconnect` from there.

```tsx highlight="4,6"
import { useRoom } from "../liveblocks.config";

export function App() {
  const room = useRoom();

  return <button onClick={room.reconnect}>Reauthenticate</button>;
}
```
