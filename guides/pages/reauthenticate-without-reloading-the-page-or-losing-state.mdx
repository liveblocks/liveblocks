By calling
[room.reconnect](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Room.reconnect) you can
reconnect and reauthenticate your collaborative application without refreshing
the page or unmounting the `RoomProvider` component. Using this method will
preserve the current client’s state, such as the undo/redo history.

```ts highlight="5"
const room = client.enter("my-room", {
  // ...
});

room.reconnect();
```

### In React

In our React package, you can retrieve the current room with the
[`useRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useRoom) hook, before calling
`room.reconnect` from there.

```tsx highlight="4,6"
import { useRoom } from "../liveblocks.config";

export function App() {
  const room = useRoom();

  return <button onClick={room.reconnect}>Reauthenticate</button>;
}
```
