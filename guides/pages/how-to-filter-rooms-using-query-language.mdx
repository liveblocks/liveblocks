When retrieving rooms with our REST API, it’s possible to filter for specific
threads using [custom metadata](/docs/products/comments/metadata) and room ID
prefixes using our custom query language. This enables the
[Get Rooms REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms) to have
filtering that works the same as with
[`liveblocks.getRooms`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms).

## Query language

You can filter rooms by their metadata and room ID prefixes. Filters can be
combined using `AND` logic.

```js
// Rooms with IDs that begin with "liveblocks:"
roomId^:'liveblocks:'

// Rooms with { status: 'open' } string metadata
metadata['roomType']:'whiteboard'

// Combine queries with AND
roomId^:'liveblocks:' AND metadata['roomType']:'whiteboard'
```

The `AND` is optional and can actually be omitted, but we’re using it here for
clarity.

### How to use

To use the query language with the
[REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms) pass your query
string to the `query` parameter. For example, given this query:

```
roomId^:'liveblocks:' AND metadata['roomType']:'whiteboard'
```

Encode it, and add it to the `query` parameter:

```
https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms?query=roomId%5E%3A'liveblocks%3A'%20AND%20metadata%5B'roomType'%5D%3A'whiteboard'
```
