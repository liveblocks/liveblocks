    "Learn how to filter for certain rooms using their names and metadata with
    our query language"

When retrieving rooms with our REST API, it’s possible to filter for specific
threads using [custom metadata](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/metadata) and
room ID prefixes using our custom query language. This enables the
[Get Rooms REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms) to have
filtering that works the same as with
[`liveblocks.getRooms`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms).

## Query language

You can filter rooms by their metadata and room ID prefixes, which is helpful
when you’re using a
[naming pattern](/docs/authentication/access-token#Naming-pattern) for your
rooms. Filters can be combined using `AND` logic.

```js
// Rooms with IDs that begin with "liveblocks:"
roomId^'liveblocks:'

// Rooms with { roomType: 'whiteboard' } string metadata
metadata['roomType']:'whiteboard'

// Combine queries with AND
roomId^'liveblocks:' AND metadata['roomType']:'whiteboard'

// Use multiple metadata filters at once
metadata['roomType']:'whiteboard' AND metadata['creator']:'florent'
```

The `AND` is optional and can actually be omitted, but we’re using it here for
clarity.

Note that room metadata can contain `strings` or `arrays`, but only `strings`
can be filtered. If you wish to return a single specific room, instead use the
[Get Room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId) or
[`liveblocks.getRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms-roomId).

### How to use

To use the query language with the
[REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms) pass your query
string to the `query` parameter. For example, given this query:

```js
roomId^'liveblocks:' AND metadata['roomType']:'whiteboard'
```

Encode it, and add it to the `query` parameter:

```
https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms?query=roomId%5E'liveblocks%3A'%20AND%20metadata%5B'roomType'%5D%3A'whiteboard'
```
