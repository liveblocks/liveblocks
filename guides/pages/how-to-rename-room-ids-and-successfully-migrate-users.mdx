When using [access token authentication](/docs/authentication/access-token) we
recommend using a naming pattern for your room IDs. If you’ve already created
rooms, it’s possible to rename them with `@liveblocks/node` or our REST API.

## Update your room IDs

To rename a room ID, you can use the
[liveblocks.updateRoomId](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-update-roomId)
endpoint to update a room ID.

```ts
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

const room = await liveblocks.updateRoomId({
  roomId: "my-room-id",
  newRoomId: "new-room-id",
});

// { type: "room", id: "new-room-id", ... }
console.log(room);
```

When you change a room ID, currently connected users will disconnect, but there
is a way around this.

## Handle active users connected to a room

To avoid users disconnecting after the change, you can listen for a room ID
changed error, `4006`, with
[`useErrorListener`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useErrorListener) or
[`room.subscribe("error")`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Room.subscribe.error).
This error is sent immediately after the ID is changed, and it returns the new
room ID inside `error.message`. You can use this the new ID to redirect users to
the new location of the room in your application.

```tsx
import { useErrorListener } from "../liveblocks.config";

function App() {
  useErrorListener((error) => {
    if (error.context.code === 4006) {
      // Room ID has been changed, get the new ID and redirect
      const newRoomId = error.message;
      __redirect__(`https://example.com/document/${newRoomId}`);
    }
  });
}
```

After implementing this, you can safely update the room ID, and users will be
immediately redirected to the new location.
