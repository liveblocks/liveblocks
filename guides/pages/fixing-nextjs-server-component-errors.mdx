## Fixing the warning: "Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components from Server Components"

This error occurs when you create a Liveblocks data structure (`LiveObject`,
`LiveList`, or `LiveMap`) within a server component. This is often occurs when
creating a room with `RoomProvider`, for example:

```tsx file="layout.tsx"
import { ReactNode } from "react";
import { RoomProvider } from "../liveblocks.config";
import { LiveObject } from "@liveblocks/client";

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <RoomProvider
          id="my-room-name"
          initialPresence={{}}
          initialStorage={{
            // ❌ This line causes the error
            session: new LiveObject(),
          }}
        >
          {children}
        </RoomProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

This can be fixed by turning the file into a client file with `"use client";` at
the top of the file. However, if your need a server component, you can extract
the provider to a different file.
