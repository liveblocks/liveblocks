[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/notifications) allows you to add
in-app notifications to your product. However, it also allows you to send unread
notifications on other channels, such as email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, a great
way to link back to your app and keep users engaged. Additionally, Liveblocks
allows your end users to individually choose which notifications they should
receive, and on which channel. This guide shows you how to create a notification
preferences panel, which enables this.

## Set up webhooks first

Before starting, it’s important that you’ve already set up a notification
channel in our dashboard, and set up a webhook endpoint. Here are two guides
that take you through how to do this:

- [How to send email notifications of unread comments](/docs/guides/how-to-send-email-notifications-of-unread-comments).
- [How to send email notifications for unread text editor mentions](/docs/guides/how-to-send-email-notifications-for-unread-text-editor-mentions).

## Enabling a notification channel

If you’ve followed one of the previous guides, you should already have a enabled
a notification kind for a certain channel in the Notifications dashboard (this
is different to setting up a webhook), however if you already have a production
project, make sure of
[what to check before enabling a notification kind](/docs/guides/what-to-check-before-enabling-a-new-notification-kind)
before continuing, as you may change the behavior of your app.

Each notification channel has a different name, such as `email` or `slack`, but
they all work in the same way. They have different names so you, as a developer,
can use them in different ways.

## Building the interface

Now that the back end’s set up, you can use Liveblocks hooks to build the
interface.
