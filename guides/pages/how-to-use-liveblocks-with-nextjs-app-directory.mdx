A pattern we’d recommend when using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) /app directory
is creating a `Room.tsx` client component in the current route, and using
`RoomProvider` within here.

```tsx file="Room.tsx"
"use client";

import { ReactNode } from "react";
import { RoomProvider } from "../liveblocks.config";
import { LiveObject } from "@liveblocks/client";

export default Room({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <RoomProvider
      id="my-room-name"
      initialPresence={{}}
      initialStorage={{
        // ✅ This is a client component, so everything works!
        session: new LiveObject(),
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </RoomProvider>
  );
}
```

Doing this avoids an issue when importing `LiveObject/LiveMap/ListList` into
server components. You can then use `Room.tsx` in your server component, and
everything will work as expected.

```tsx file="layout.tsx"
import { ReactNode } from "react";
import { Room } from "./Room";

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Room>{children}</Room>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Structuring your app

To take this one step further, you can then server-render your layout within
`Room`’s `children`, whilst using other client components for real-time parts of
your app:

```tsx file="room.tsx"
import { ReactNode } from "react";
import { Room } from "./Room";
import { LiveCanvas } from "./LiveCanvas";

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* Room.tsx is a client component that contains RoomProvider */}
        <Room>
          {/* This layout is server rendered */}
          <header style={{ height: "150px" }}>My drawing app</header>
          <main style={{ width: "100%" }}>
            {/* LiveCanvas is a client component using Liveblocks features */}
            <LiveCanvas />
          </main>
        </Room>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
