<Banner title="Looking for more complex permissions?" type="warning">

If you’re looking to build an application with permissions at organization,
group, and user levels, we recommend using
[ID tokens](/docs/authentication/id-token) instead. Access tokens have
[limitations when granting nested permissions](#limitations).

</Banner>

With [access tokens](/docs/authentication/access-token) we always recommend
using a [naming pattern](/docs/authentication/access-token#Naming-pattern) to
grant access to multiple rooms at once, for example every room in a user’s
organization.

```ts
// ✅ Grants access to every `acme` organization room
session.allow(`session.allow(`acme:*`, session.FULL_ACCESS);
```

However, it may not always be possible to grant access to every room with a
wildcard and naming pattern. One example would be if a user is invited to _only
one room_ in a _different_ organization. There’s a way to work around this
limitation.

## Grant access to individual rooms

When using
[`authEndpoint`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientAuthEndpoint),
Liveblocks provides the current room ID in the `request`. Below is a Next.js
example, where the current room ID is taken from the body, and the user is
allowed access to the room. Note that `room` is `undefined` when
[Notifications](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/notifications) is
authenticating, which is why we’re checking if it exists. Notifications works
across rooms, and it doesn’t require any permissions.

```tsx highlight="17,19-21"
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Get the current user from your database
  const user = __getUserFromDB__(request);

  // Start an auth session inside your endpoint
  const session = liveblocks.prepareSession(
    user.id,
    { userInfo: user.metadata } // Optional
  );

  const { room } = request.body;

  if (room && __shouldUserHaveAccess__(user, room)) {
    session.allow(room, session.FULL_ACCESS);
  }

  // Authorize the user and return the result
  const { status, body } = await session.authorize();
  return new Response(body, { status });
}
```

This approach relies on you creating the `__shouldUserHaveAccess__` function,
and determining whether the user is allowed inside the room.
