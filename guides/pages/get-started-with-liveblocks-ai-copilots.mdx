Turn your app into an AI-assisted, collaborative experience using Liveblocks AI
Copilots. This guide walks you from zero to an interactive chat UI, backed by a
Copilot configured on the Liveblocks platform, with optional custom tools and
knowledge.

## What we're building

In this guide, we'll be building a simple AI chat interface, backed by a Copilot
configured on the Liveblocks platform. We'll also add a custom tool to the
Copilot, and add knowledge to the Copilot. We'll be looking at how to:

- Create and configure a copilot on the Liveblocks platform with your preferred
  LLM provider and system prompt.
- Create a chat instance bound to your Copilot.
- Use our ready-made chat UI component,
- Create a custom AI tool the copilot can use.

## What are AI Copilots?

AI Copilots are configurable, stateful AI assistants you embed into your
application. They combine a large language model with your system prompt,
optional knowledge sources, and callable “tools” (functions) to answer
questions, retrieve data, and perform actions—all delivered through ready‑made
UI components and APIs.
