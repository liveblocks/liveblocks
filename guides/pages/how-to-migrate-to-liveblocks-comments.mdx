    Comments in this migration guide."
---

To migrate your threads, comments, and reactions to Liveblocks Comments, you can
create a migration script using our
[Node.js methods](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) or
[REST API](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints). This
guide will take you through all the Liveblocks features required to create a
migration script in Node.js. Note that each Node.js method also has an
equivalent REST API which could be used instead.

Before starting to migrate, make sure to
[set up authentication](https://liveblocks.io/docs/authentication) in your app,
deciding on either _ID tokens_ or _access tokens_.

## Creating rooms

The first step is to create the multiplayer room where the comments are stored.
This is equivalent to a document in your project. Make sure to read the sections
on permissions under
[access tokens](/docs/authentication/access-token#permissions) or
[ID tokens](/docs/authentication/id-token#permissions) to fully understand
setting up your room.

Create a room using
[`liveblocks.createRoom`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms) or the
[Create Room API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms), and set
permissions if you’re using ID tokens.

```ts
// The unique ID for the room
const roomId = "my-room-id";

// Create a room
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom(roomId, {
  // If you're using ID tokens, set your permissions/accesses, examples below
  defaultAccesses: [
    // "room:write"`
  ],
  // groupsAccesses: {
  //   my-group: ["room:write"]
  // }
  // usersAccesses: {
  //   my-user: ["room:write"]
  // }
});
```

## Creating threads

Next up is creating threads in the room. Before starting, make sure you
understand the
[concepts behind Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/concepts). When a
thread is created, the first comment is also created, and you can do this with
[`liveblocks.createThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId-threads)
or the
[Create Thread API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId-threads).

```ts
// The unique ID for the room
const roomId = "my-room-id";

// Create a room
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom(roomId, {
  defaultAccesses: [],
});

//+++
// Create a thread
const thread = await liveblocks.createThread({
  roomId,

  data: {
    comment: {
      // ID of the user that created the thread
      userId: "florent@example.com",

      body: {
        version: 1,
        content: [
          // The initial comment's body text goes here
          // {
          //   type: "paragraph",
          //   children: [{ text: "Hello " }, { text: "world", bold: true }],
          // },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
});
// +++
```

Read under
[`liveblocks.createThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId-threads)
to learn how to create a Comment body, and check in
[GitHub](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/blob/64a2f5707785b95b1f56d7ff3b53a234dfc9ccd7/packages/liveblocks-core/src/protocol/Comments.ts#L55)
for information about each comment body element.

## Adding further comments

To add more comments to the new thread, use
[`liveblocks.createComment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId-comments)
or the
[Create Comment API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId-comments).
We’re just sharing a simple code snippet below, but of course, we recommend you
use a loop.

```ts
// The unique ID for the room
const roomId = "my-room-id";

// Create a room
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom(roomId, {
  defaultAccesses: [],
});

// Create a thread
const thread = await liveblocks.createThread({
  /* ... */
});

// +++
// Adding a comment to the existing thread
const comment = await liveblocks.createComment({
  roomId,
  threadId: thread.id,

  data: {
    // ID of the user that created the comment
    userId: "pierre@example.com",

    // Optional, when the comment was created
    createdAt: new Date(),

    body: {
      version: 1,
      content: [
        // The comment's body text goes here
        // {
        //   type: "paragraph",
        //   children: [{ text: "Hello " }, { text: "world", bold: true }],
        // },
      ],
    },
  },
});
// +++
```

## Adding reactions

To add reactions to each comment, use
[`liveblocks.addCommentReaction`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#post-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId-comments-commentId-add-reaction)
or the
[Add Comment Reaction API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#post-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId-comments-commentId-add-reaction).

```ts
// The unique ID for the room
const roomId = "my-room-id";

// Create a room
const room = await liveblocks.createRoom(roomId, {
  defaultAccesses: [],
});

// Create a thread
const thread = await liveblocks.createThread({
  /* ... */
});

// Adding a comment to the existing thread
const comment = await liveblocks.createComment({
  /* ... */
});

// +++
// Add a reaction to a comment
const reaction = await liveblocks.addCommentReaction({
  roomId,
  threadId: thread.id,
  commentId: comment.id,

  data: {
    // The reaction emoji
    emoji: "✅",

    // ID of the user that reacted
    userId: "guillaume@example.com",

    // Optional, the time the reaction was added
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
});
// +++
```

## Migrating users

There’s no need to migrate users to Comments, as the only user information
Liveblocks stores
[is each user’s ID](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/users-and-mentions).
Other user info is retrieved in-app by Comments with
[`resolveUserInfo`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProviderResolveUsers).

## Putting it together

To create a migration script, put everything together and loop through all the
functions we’ve listed above. Below is an example of a migration script, though
you’ll need to make changes based on the format of the comment system you’re
migrating from. `oldDocumentId` and `oldDocumentThreads` represent your current
data.

```tsx
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

async function migrateDocument({ oldDocumentId, oldDocumentThreads }) {
  console.log(`Migrating document: ${oldDocumentId}`);

  // The unique ID for the room
  const roomId = oldDocumentId;

  // Create a Liveblocks room
  const room = await liveblocks.createRoom(roomId, {
    // If you're using ID tokens, set your permissions/accesses, examples below
    defaultAccesses: [
      // "room:write"`
    ],
    // groupsAccesses: {
    //   my-group: ["room:write"]
    // }
    // usersAccesses: {
    //   my-user: ["room:write"]
    // }
  });

  // Loop through your existing threads for the current room
  for (const oldThread of oldDocumentThreads) {
    const [firstComment, ...otherComments] = oldThread.comments;

    // Create a Liveblocks thread
    const thread = await liveblocks.createThread({
      roomId: room.id,

      data: {
        comment: {
          // ID of the user that created the thread
          userId: firstComment.userId,

          body: {
            version: 1,
            content: __convertCommentToLiveblocksFormat__(firstComment.body),
          },
        },
      },
    });

    // Loop through this existing thread's comments
    for (const oldComment of otherComments) {
      // Create a Liveblocks comment
      const comment = await liveblocks.createComment({
        roomId: room.id,
        threadId: thread.id,

        data: {
          // ID of the user that created the comment
          userId: oldComment.userId,

          // Optional, when the comment was created
          createdAt: new Date(oldComment.timestamp),

          body: {
            version: 1,
            content: __convertCommentToLiveblocksFormat__(oldComment.body),
          },
        },
      });

      // Loop through this existing comment's reactions
      for (const oldReaction of oldComment.reactions) {
        // Add a reaction to a Liveblocks comment
        await liveblocks.addCommentReaction({
          roomId: room.id,
          threadId: thread.id,
          commentId: comment.id,

          data: {
            // The reaction emoji
            emoji: oldReaction.emoji,

            // ID of the user that reacted
            userId: oldReaction.userId,

            // Optional, the time the reaction was added
            createdAt: new Date(oldReaction.timestamp),
          },
        });
      }
    }
  }

  console.log(`Document migrated: ${oldDocumentId}`);
}
```
