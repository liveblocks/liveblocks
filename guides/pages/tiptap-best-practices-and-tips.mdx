This guide covers best practices and common pitfalls to avoid when working with
Tiptap and Liveblocks.

<Banner title="Tiptap is backed by Yjs" type="note">

Tiptap uses [Yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev/) for synchronization. Make sure to also
check out our [Yjs best practices and tips](/guides/yjs-best-practices-and-tips)
guide for additional recommendations.

## Always include StarterKit or Doc, Paragraph extensions

The Tiptap
[StarterKit](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit)
extension is **required** for Tiptap to function properly. It provides essential
node types that every Tiptap editor needs, specifically the `Doc` and
`Paragraph` nodes. Alternatively you can include only the [Doc](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/nodes/document) and [Paragraph](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/nodes/paragraph)
extensions.

### Why StarterKit is required

Tiptap documents must have a root `Doc` node and at least one `Paragraph` node
to maintain a valid document structure. Without these core nodes, the editor
will not work correctly and synchronization will fail.

```tsx
import { useEditor } from "@tiptap/react";
import StarterKit from "@tiptap/starter-kit";

const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({
      history: false, // Required - disable history for Liveblocks
    }),
    // Add other extensions here
  ],
});
```

### What StarterKit includes

In addition to the required `Doc` and `Paragraph` nodes, StarterKit also
includes commonly used extensions like:

- Text formatting (Bold, Italic, Strike, Code)
- Block types (Heading, Blockquote, CodeBlock, BulletList, OrderedList,
  ListItem)
- Horizontal rule and hard break
- History (undo/redo) (This must be disabled to work with Liveblocks)

If you need more control over which extensions are included, you can configure
StarterKit to disable specific extensions:

```tsx
const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({
      // Disable extensions you don't need
      heading: false,
      blockquote: false,
      // Must be disabled for Liveblocks
      history: false, // renamed to undoRedo: false in TipTap3
    }),
  ],
});
```

However, you should **never disable** the `doc` or `paragraph` options, as these
are required for the editor to function.

## Disable server-side rendering with immediatelyRender: false

When using Tiptap with server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks like Next.js, you
should **always set `immediatelyRender: false`** in your `useEditor` hook.
Tiptap should never be rendered on the server.

### Why disable server-side rendering?

Tiptap is a client-side editor that relies on browser APIs and the DOM. When
rendered on the server, it can cause:

- Hydration mismatches between server and client
- Errors related to missing browser APIs

### How to disable server-side rendering

Set `immediatelyRender: false` in your `useEditor` configuration:

```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT: Disable server-side rendering for Next.js and other SSR frameworks
import { useEditor } from "@tiptap/react";
import { useLiveblocksExtension } from "@liveblocks/react-tiptap";
import StarterKit from "@tiptap/starter-kit";

function Editor() {
  const liveblocks = useLiveblocksExtension();

  const editor = useEditor({
    immediatelyRender: false, // Required for SSR frameworks like Next.js
    extensions: [
      StarterKit.configure({
        history: false, // Required - disable history for Liveblocks
      }),
      liveblocks,
    ],
  });

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />;
}
```

This ensures that Tiptap is only rendered on the client side, avoiding any
server-side rendering issues.

If you're using Next.js (App Router or Pages Router) or any other SSR framework,
**always set `immediatelyRender: false`**. Failing to do so will cause hydration
errors and other unexpected behavior.

## Enable content validation

Tiptap has a schema that defines the structure of your document. By default,
Tiptap does **not validate content** against this schema. When invalid content
is present, it will **silently break synchronization** without any error
messages.

This can happen when:

- Extensions are added or removed from the editor
- The schema changes between different versions of your application
- Users collaborate on documents with different editor configurations

### How to enable content validation

Always enable content validation by setting `enableContentCheck: true` and
implementing an `onContentError` handler:

```tsx
import { useEditor } from "@tiptap/react";
import StarterKit from "@tiptap/starter-kit";

const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({
      history: false, // Required - disable history for Liveblocks
    }),
  ],
  enableContentCheck: true,
  onContentError: ({ editor, error, disableCollaboration }) => {
    // Disable collaboration to prevent data corruption
    disableCollaboration();

    // Make the editor read-only to prevent further changes
    editor.setEditable(false, false);

    // Log the error for debugging
    console.error("Content validation error:", error);

    // Notify the user that there's an issue
    alert(
      "There was an error loading this document. The content may be incompatible with the current editor version. The document has been made read-only to prevent data loss."
    );
  },
});
```

This ensures that:

- Invalid content is detected early
- Collaboration is disabled to prevent data corruption
- The editor is made read-only to prevent further changes
- The issue is logged for debugging
- Users are notified of the problem

## Use initialContent instead of content

When setting default content for your Tiptap editor, always use `initialContent`
instead of `content`. Using `content` will cause the content to be duplicated
every time the page loads or the component re-renders.

### The problem with content

The `content` option in Tiptap sets the editor content every time the editor is
initialized. When using Liveblocks, this means the content will be **added** to
the existing document rather than replacing it, causing duplication:

```tsx
// ❌ AVOID: This will duplicate content on every page load
const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({
      history: false, // Required - disable history for Liveblocks
    }),
    liveblocks,
  ],
  content: "<p>Default text</p>", // This gets added every time!
});
```

### Use initialContent instead

The `initialContent` option sets a flag internally and only sets the content the
**very first time** the document is empty. This prevents duplication:

```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT: This only sets content once
import { useEditor } from "@tiptap/react";
import { useLiveblocksExtension } from "@liveblocks/react-tiptap";
import StarterKit from "@tiptap/starter-kit";

function Editor() {
  const liveblocks = useLiveblocksExtension();

  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit.configure({
        history: false, // Required - disable history for Liveblocks
      }),
      liveblocks,
    ],
    initialContent: "<p>Default text</p>", // Only set on first load
  });

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />;
}
```

<Banner title="Not compatible with the field option" type="warning">

The `initialContent` option does not currently work when using the `field`
option for multiple editors. If you need to set initial content for multiple
editors, you'll need to implement your own logic to check if the document is
empty before setting content.

## Support multiple editors with the field option

If you want to display multiple Tiptap editors on the same page, use the `field`
option with a unique identifier for each editor. This ensures that each editor
synchronizes to its own section of the Yjs document.

```tsx
import { useEditor } from "@tiptap/react";
import { useLiveblocksExtension } from "@liveblocks/react-tiptap";
import StarterKit from "@tiptap/starter-kit";

function EditorOne() {
  const liveblocks = useLiveblocksExtension({
    field: "editor-1", // Unique identifier for this editor
  });

  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit.configure({
        history: false, // Required - disable history for Liveblocks
      }),
      liveblocks,
    ],
  });

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />;
}

function EditorTwo() {
  const liveblocks = useLiveblocksExtension({
    field: "editor-2", // Different unique identifier
  });

  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit.configure({
        history: false, // Required - disable history for Liveblocks
      }),
      liveblocks,
    ],
  });

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />;
}
```

Without the `field` option, both editors would synchronize to the same location
in the document, causing conflicts and data loss.

## Never use extensions with binary data

Never use Tiptap extensions that store binary data (such as base64-encoded
images) directly in the document. Binary data will be synchronized across all
clients and can fill up your room extremely quickly, leading to:

- Increased bandwidth usage
- Slower synchronization
- Higher storage costs
- Potential rate limiting

### Common pitfall: Image extension

The official Tiptap
[Image extension](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/nodes/image) has an
`allowBase64` option. This option is **defaulted to `false`**, and it should
**never be set to `true`**.

```tsx
// ❌ NEVER DO THIS
import Image from "@tiptap/extension-image";

const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({
      history: false, // Required - disable history for Liveblocks
    }),
    Image.configure({
      allowBase64: true, // This will cause problems!
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Recommended approach

Instead of storing images as base64 in the document:

1. Upload images to a file storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Vercel
   Blob)
2. Store only the URL in the document
3. Reference the URL in your image nodes

```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT: Store only URLs
import Image from "@tiptap/extension-image";

const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({
      history: false, // Required - disable history for Liveblocks
    }),
    Image.configure({
      allowBase64: false, // Default, but explicit is better
    }),
  ],
});

// When adding an image
editor.commands.setImage({
  src: "https://your-storage.com/images/photo.jpg", // URL only, no base64
});
```

## Prevent users from losing unsaved changes

To prevent users from accidentally losing their work when closing the browser
tab or navigating away, enable the `preventUnsavedChanges` option:

```tsx
import { RoomProvider } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";

<RoomProvider
  id="my-room"
  initialPresence={{}}
  preventUnsavedChanges={true} // Warn users before they leave with unsaved changes
>
  {/* Your components */}
</RoomProvider>;
```

This will display a browser confirmation dialog when users try to leave the page
with unsaved changes, helping prevent accidental data loss.
