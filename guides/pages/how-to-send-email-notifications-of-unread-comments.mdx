Liveblocks [Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments) allows you to build a
commenting experience. With our webhooks and REST API, it’s possible to
aggregate a list of unread comments from the last 30 minutes into a single
email, and send it to your users. Notifications can also be displayed in your
app using
[`useInboxNotifications`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useInboxNotifications)
and the
[`InboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#InboxNotification)
component.

We have an example containing ready-made email templates, built with React
Email. This a great starting point for your Comments notification emails:
[Comments emails example](/examples/comments-emails/nextjs-comments-emails-resend).
We also have a second example that shows you how to
[send simple HTML emails](/examples/comments-emails/nextjs-comments-emails-sendgrid).

## What we’re building

In this guide we’ll be learning how to send emails notifying users about unread
comments, and more specifically, we’ll be looking at how to:

- Trigger events based on unread comments using the
  [`NotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent) webhook
  event.
- Fetch unread comments and add styles to comment text using the
  [`@liveblocks/emails`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails) package.
- Send an email notification containing a list of unread comments in thread
  format with [Resend](https://resend.com/).

<Banner title="Have a project ready">

This guide assumes you already have a Liveblocks Comments project set up. If you
don’t have one yet, you can
[get started with Comments](/docs/get-started/comments), and come back after
you’re set up. You could also use our
[Comments emails example](/examples/comments-emails/nextjs-comments-emails-resend)
which has this set up already, alongside ready-made email templates.

## What are inbox notifications?

Email notifications are built around the concept of inbox notifications, which
are different from “normal” notifications in the sense that they can group
multiple activities together and evolve over time, which makes more sense when
sending email notifications because it helps to avoid sending too many emails.
In the case of Comments, inbox notifications are grouped per thread, which means
that if there are 4 new comments in a thread you’re participating in, you will
have a single inbox notification for it, instead of 4 “normal” notifications.

Learn more about Notifications for Comments in the
[overview page](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/email-notifications).

## Using webhooks

Liveblocks provides a number of [webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks) that can
send requests to your API endpoint when certain events occurs. One webhook we
provide is the [`NotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent)
webhook, which is triggered for each participating user in a thread, 30 minutes
after activity has occurred, and this can be used to send emails to your users.

The information it returns allows you to retrieve comments that have not yet
been read by the user, making it possible to aggregate multiple unread comments
into a single notification email. Let’s take a look at how to set this up.

### Notification channels

You can send notifications via different channels, such as email, Slack,
Microsoft Teams, and Web Push. In our dashboard, you can enable notifications on
certain channels, and in this case, we’ll be using the email channel. You must
always enable the correct channel to ensure your
[`NotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent) webhook events
are triggered, and this guide will take you through setting it up.

## Create an endpoint in your project

When a webhook event is triggered, it can send a POST request to the back end in
your project. In this guide, we’ll be using a Next.js route handler (API
endpoint) as an example, but other frameworks work similarly.

In order to use webhooks, we’ll need to retrieve the `headers` and `body` from
the request. Here’s the basic endpoint we’ll be starting from:

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Handle webhooks and notifications
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

Create this endpoint in your project, and make it available on `localhost` at
the following URL:

```
/api/liveblocks-notifications
```

Make a note of this endpoint URL, as you’ll be using it later.

### Testing webhooks locally

Running webhooks locally can be difficult, but one way to do this is to use a
tool such as [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) or
[`ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) which allow you to temporarily
put your localhost server online.

If your project is running on `localhost:3000`, you can run the following
command to generate a temporary URL that’s available while your localhost server
is running:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

`localtunnel` generates a base URL that can be placed into the Liveblocks
webhooks dashboard for quick testing. To use this, take the full address of your
webhook endpoint, and replace the domain in your `localhost` address with the
generated URL.

```shell
# Take your local URL
http://localhost:3000/api/liveblocks-notifications

# Replace localhost with the generated domain, then copy it
https://my-localtunnel-url.loca.lt/api/liveblocks-notifications
```

You now have a URL that can be used in the webhooks dashboard.

## Set up webhooks on the Liveblocks dashboard

To use webhooks, you need to pass your endpoint URL to the webhooks dashboard
inside your Liveblocks project, and tell the webhook to trigger when a comment
has been created.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify the webhook request

The [`@liveblocks/node`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) package provides
you with a function that verifies whether the current request is a real webhook
request from Liveblocks. You can set this up by setting up a
[`WebhookHandler`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#WebhookHandler) and
running [`verifyRequest`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#verifyRequest).

Make sure to add your “Webhook secret key” from the Liveblocks dashboard—in a
real project we’d recommend using an environment variable for this.

```ts highlight="1,3-5,11-21"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // Send notifications
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Check the event and notification permissions

After verifying the request, we can then check we’re receiving the correct type
of event, on the correct channel. There are different `notification` events, and
in this case we’d like to check for
[thread notification](/docs/platform/webhooks#Thread-notification), as we’re
specifically listening for new comments. We can do this using
[`ThreadNotificationEvent`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#isThreadNotificationEvent),
making sure to check for the `email` channel.

```ts
import { WebhookHandler, isThreadNotificationEvent } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // +++
  // When an inbox notification has been created on the email channel
  if (isThreadNotificationEvent(event) && event.data.channel === "email") {
    // Check if user has access to room
    if (!__hasRoomAccess__(event.userId, event.roomId)) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    // The user to send the email to
    const emailAddress = __getEmailAddressFromDB__(event.userId);

    // Send notifications
    // ...
  }
  // +++

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

Note that we’re also checking if the user should receive a notification, and
getting their email address—Liveblocks doesn’t have knowledge of your
permissions system on the back end, so it’s your responsibility to check if this
user should have access to the room.

## Fetching data for emails

[`@liveblocks/emails`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails) provides functions
for fetching unread comments and styling emails, returning them as either React
components or an HTML string. In this guide we’ll use the React function, but
the HTML function works almost identically, so you can still follow along if
you’d prefer HTML emails.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/emails/new-comments-email.png"
    alt="An email showing 7 new comments, with comment bodies and links to each comment"
    width={1567}
    height={830}
  />
</Figure>

First set up your
[`Liveblocks`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#Liveblocks-client) Node.js
client and wrap
[`prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails#prepare-thread-notification-email-as-react)
in `try/catch`, getting the data for the email.

<Banner>

If you’d prefer your email content as an HTML string, use
[`prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsHtml`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails#prepare-thread-notification-email-as-html).

</Banner>

```ts
import {
  // +++
  Liveblocks,
  // +++
  WebhookHandler,
  isThreadNotificationEvent,
} from "@liveblocks/node";
// +++
import { prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact } from "@liveblocks/emails";
// +++

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// +++
// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });
// +++

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When an inbox notification has been created on the email channel
  if (isThreadNotificationEvent(event) && event.data.channel === "email") {
    // Check if user has access to room
    if (!__hasRoomAccess__(event.userId, event.roomId)) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    // The user to send the email to
    const emailAddress = __getEmailAddressFromDB__(event.userId);

    // +++
    let emailData;

    try {
      emailData = await prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact(
        liveblocks,
        event
      );
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return new Response("Could not fetch thread notification data", {
        status: 500,
      });
    }

    // All comments have already been read
    if (!emailData) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    // Create emails
    // ...
    // +++
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Create the emails

Next, we need to create the emails with React.
[`prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails#prepare-thread-notification-email-as-react)
helps you identify two different thread notification types, _unread replies_ in
a thread, or an _unread mention_ in a comment. We can choose to create different
emails for these cases.

```tsx
import {
  Liveblocks,
  WebhookHandler,
  isThreadNotificationEvent,
} from "@liveblocks/node";
import { prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact } from "@liveblocks/emails";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When an inbox notification has been created on the email channel
  if (isThreadNotificationEvent(event) && event.data.channel === "email") {
    // Check if user has access to room
    if (!__hasRoomAccess__(event.userId, event.roomId)) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    // The user to send the email to
    const emailAddress = __getEmailAddressFromDB__(event.userId);

    let emailData;

    try {
      emailData = await prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact(
        liveblocks,
        event
      );
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return new Response("Could not fetch thread notification data", {
        status: 500,
      });
    }

    // All comments have already been read
    if (!emailData) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    // +++
    let email;
    switch (emailData.type) {
      case "unreadMention": {
        email = (
          <div>
            <div>
              @{emailData.comment.author.id} at {emailData.comment.createdAt}
            </div>
            <div>{emailData.comment.body}</div>
          </div>
        );
        break;
      }

      case "unreadReplies": {
        email = (
          <div>
            {emailData.comments.map((comment) => (
              <div key={comment.id}>
                <div>
                  @{comment.author.id} at {comment.createdAt}
                </div>
                <div>{comment.body}</div>
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        );
        break;
      }
    }
    // +++

    // Send emails
    // ...
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Resolving data

We’ve now fully created a basic React email, and it’s ready to send. However,
we’re displaying each user’s ID, and not their names. We can go back to
[`prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails#prepare-thread-notification-email-as-react)
and use resolver functions to transform an ID into a name, for example
`steven@example.com` -> `Steven`. These functions work similarly to
[resolvers on the client](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#LiveblocksProviderResolveUsers).

```tsx
// ...

emailData = await prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact(liveblocks, event, {
  // +++
  resolveUsers: async ({ userIds }) => {
    const usersData = await __getUsersFromDB__(userIds);

    return usersData.map((userData) => ({
      name: userData.name, // "Steven"
      avatar: userData.avatar.src, // "https://example.com/steven.jpg"
    }));
  },
  resolveRoomInfo: async ({ roomId }) => {
    const roomData = await __getRoomFromDB__(roomId);

    return {
      name: roomData.name, // "Untitled document"
      url: roomData.url, //`https://example.com/my-room-id`
    };
  },
  // +++
});

// ...
```

## Customizing comment components

We can also edit `prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact` to allow for
[custom components in comment bodies](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails#prepare-thread-notification-email-as-react-customizing-components),
for example we can add margin around a paragraph, color mentions, and underline
links.

```tsx
// ...

emailData = await prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact(liveblocks, event, {
  resolveUsers: async ({ userIds }) => {
    const usersData = await __getUsersFromDB__(userIds);

    return usersData.map((userData) => ({
      name: userData.name, // "Steven"
      avatar: userData.avatar.src, // "https://example.com/steven.jpg"
    }));
  },
  resolveRoomInfo: async ({ roomId }) => {
    const roomData = await __getRoomFromDB__(roomId);

    return {
      name: roomData.name, // "Untitled document"
      url: roomData.url, //`https://example.com/my-room-id`
    };
  },
  // +++
  components: {
    Paragraph: ({ children }) => <p style={{ margin: "12px 0" }}>{children}</p>,

    // `user` is the optional data returned from `resolveUsers`
    Mention: ({ element, user }) => (
      <span style={{ color: "red" }}>@{user?.name ?? element.id}</span>
    ),

    // If the link is rich-text render it, otherwise use the URL
    Link: ({ element, href }) => (
      <a href={href} style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>
        {element?.text ?? href}
      </a>
    ),
  },
  // +++
});

// ...
```

Any component can be passed here, including those used in
[`react-email`](https://react.email/),

## Send notification emails

Now that the React code has been generated, we can send the notification emails.
[Resend](https://resend.com) is a great tool for easily sending emails, and in
this code example, we’re using it to send notifications to each user. Make sure
to add your API key from the [Resend dashboard](https://resend.com/overview)
before running the code.

```tsx
import {
  Liveblocks,
  WebhookHandler,
  isThreadNotificationEvent,
} from "@liveblocks/node";
import { prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact } from "@liveblocks/emails";
// +++
import { Resend } from "resend";
// +++

// +++
// Create Resend client (add your API key)
const resend = new Resend("re_123456789");
// +++

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When an inbox notification has been created on the email channel
  if (isThreadNotificationEvent(event) && event.data.channel === "email") {
    // Check if user has access to room
    if (!__hasRoomAccess__(event.userId, event.roomId)) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    // The user to send the email to
    const emailAddress = __getEmailAddressFromDB__(event.userId);

    let emailData;

    try {
      emailData = await prepareThreadNotificationEmailAsReact(
        liveblocks,
        event,
        {
          resolveUsers: async ({ userIds }) => {
            const usersData = await __getUsersFromDB__(userIds);

            return usersData.map((userData) => ({
              name: userData.name, // "Steven"
              avatar: userData.avatar.src, // "https://example.com/steven.jpg"
            }));
          },

## Allow users to toggle notifications

Using Liveblocks hooks and methods, it’s possible to create a notifications
settings interface, allowing end users to choose which notifications they’d like
to receive, and on which channels, saving their preferences.

## Recap

Great, we’re successfully sending email notifications after new comments are
created! In this guide we’ve learned:

- How to use [webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks) and the
  [`NotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent).
- How to use the [`@liveblocks/emails`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails)
  package to fetch and render unread thread data.
- How to send email notifications with [Resend](https://resend.com).
