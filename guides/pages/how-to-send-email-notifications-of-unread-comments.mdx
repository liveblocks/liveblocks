Liveblocks [Comments](/docs/products/comments) allows you to build a commenting
experience. With our webhooks and REST API, it’s possible to aggregate a list of
unread comments from the last 30 minutes into a single email, and send it to
your users. Notifications can also be displayed in your app using
[`useInboxNotifications`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useInboxNotifications)
and the
[`InboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-comments#InboxNotification)
component.

If you’re looking for a guide on sending an email containing one comment,
immediately after every single comment is created, then
[sending emails when comments are created](/docs/guides/how-to-send-email-notifications-when-comments-are-created)
is for you.

## What we’re building

In this guide we’ll be learning how to send emails notifying users about unread
comments, and more specifically, we’ll be looking at how to:

- Trigger events based on unread comments using the
  [`ThreadEmailNotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadEmailNotificationEvent)
  webhook event.
- Fetch unread thread data using the
  [`@liveblocks/node`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) package.
- Build an email containing correctly
  [formatted text](/docs/guides/how-to-send-email-notifications-when-comments-are-created#Generating-HTML-for-the-email).
- Send an email notification containing a list of unread comments in thread
  format with [Resend](https://resend.com/).

<Banner title="Have a project ready">

This guide assumes you already have a Liveblocks Comments project set up. If you
haven’t already got one, you can
[get started with Comments](/docs/get-started/comments), and come back after
you’re set up. You could also use our [Next.js Starter Kit](/starter-kit) which
has this set up already.

## What are inbox notifications?

Email notifications are built around the concept of inbox notifications, which
are different from “normal” notifications in the sense that they can group
multiple activities together and evolve over time, which makes more sense when
sending email notifications because it helps to avoid sending too many emails.
In the case of Comments, inbox notifications are grouped per thread, which means
that if there are 4 new comments in a thread you’re participating in, you will
have a single inbox notification for it, instead of 4 “normal” notifications.

Learn more about Notifications for Comments in the
[overview page](/docs/products/comments/notifications).

## Using webhooks

Liveblocks provides a number of [webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks) that can
send requests to your API endpoint when certain events occurs. One webhook we
provide is the
[`ThreadEmailNotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadEmailNotificationEvent)
webhook, which is triggered for each participating user in a thread, 30 minutes
after activity has occurred, and this can be used to send emails to your users.

The information it returns allows you to retrieve comments that have not yet
been read by the user, making it possible to aggregate multiple unread comments
into a single notification email. Let’s take a look at how to set this up.

## Create an endpoint in your project

When a webhook event is triggered, it can send a POST request to the back end in
your project. In this guide, we’ll be using a Next.js route handler (API
endpoint) as an example, but other frameworks work similarly.

In order to use webhooks, we’ll need to retrieve the `headers` and `body` from
the request. Here’s the basic endpoint we’ll be starting from:

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Handle webhooks and notifications
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

Create this endpoint in your project, and make it available on `localhost` at
the following URL:

```
/api/liveblocks-notifications
```

Make a note of this endpoint URL, as you’ll be using it later.

### Testing webhooks locally

Running webhooks locally can be difficult, but one way to do this is to use a
tool such as [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) or
[`ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) which allow you to temporarily
put your localhost server online.

If your project is running on `localhost:3000`, you can run the following
command to generate a temporary URL that’s available while your localhost server
is running:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

`localtunnel` generates a base URL that can be placed into the Liveblocks
webhooks dashboard for quick testing. To use this, take the full address of your
webhook endpoint, and replace the domain in your `localhost` address with the
generated URL.

```shell
# Take your local URL
http://localhost:3000/api/liveblocks-notifications

# Replace localhost with the generated domain, then copy it
https://my-localtunnel-url.loca.lt/api/liveblocks-notifications
```

You now have a URL that can be used in the webhooks dashboard.

## Set up webhooks on the Liveblocks dashboard

To use webhooks, you need to pass your endpoint URL to the webhooks dashboard
inside your Liveblocks project, and tell the webhook to trigger when a comment
has been created.

## Verify the webhook request

The [`@liveblocks/node`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) package provides
you with a function that verifies whether the current request is a real webhook
request from Liveblocks. You can set this up by setting up a
[`WebhookHandler`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#WebhookHandler) and
running [`verifyRequest`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#verifyRequest).

Make sure to add your “Webhook secret key” from the Liveblocks dashboard—in a
real project we’d recommend using an environment variable for this.

```ts highlight="1,3-5,11-21"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // Send notifications
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Check the event and notification permissions

After verifying the request, we can then check we’re receiving the correct type
of event, and check if the user should receive a notification. Liveblocks
doesn’t have knowledge of your permissions system on the back end, so it’s your
responsibility to check if this user should receive a notification.

```ts highlight="23-34"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When an inbox notification has been created
  if (event.type === "notification") {
    const { roomId, threadId, inboxNotificationId, userId } = event.data;

    // Check if user has access to room
    if (!__hasRoomAccess__(userId, roomId)) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    // Send notifications
    // ...
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

We now have the `roomId`, `threadId`, `inboxNotificationId`. and `userId` of the
created notification, along with some
[other information](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadEmailNotificationEvent).

## Get comment and thread data

<Banner title="Threads vs comments">
  Note that a thread is different to a comment—a thread is “top-level”, and each
  thread contains a list of comments. When you create a thread with
  [`useCreateThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useCreateThread), you
  also create the first comment in the thread.
</Banner>

The next step is to use the
[Liveblocks client](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#Liveblocks-client) from
`@liveblocks/node` to retrieve the inbox notification, and the corresponding
thread’s data. To do this we’ll need to add our project’s secret key to the
Liveblocks client, before awaiting the following functions:
[`getInboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-users-userId-inboxNotifications-inboxNotificationId)
and [`getThread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-thread).

```ts highlight="1,7-9,36-48"
import { Liveblocks, WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When an inbox notification has been created
  if (event.type === "notification") {
    const { roomId, threadId, inboxNotificationId, userId } = event.data;

    // Check if user has access to room
    if (!__hasRoomAccess__(userId, roomId)) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    try {
      // Get thread and notification
      const [thread, inboxNotification] = await Promise.all([
        liveblocks.getThread({ roomId, threadId }),
        liveblocks.getInboxNotification({ inboxNotificationId, userId }),
      ]);

      // Send notifications
      // ...
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return new Response("Could not fetch notification data", { status: 500 });
    }
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Get the unread comments

The next step is to get each unread comment by comparing the `readAt` time in
the inbox notification with the `createAt` time on each comment. We’re also
filtering out each comment with no body, which represents a deleted comment.

```ts highlight="43-52"
import { Liveblocks, WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When an inbox notification has been created
  if (event.type === "notification") {
    const { roomId, threadId, inboxNotificationId, userId } = event.data;

    // Check if user has access to room
    if (!__hasRoomAccess__(userId, roomId)) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    try {
      // Get thread and notification
      const [thread, inboxNotification] = await Promise.all([
        liveblocks.getThread({ roomId, threadId }),
        liveblocks.getInboxNotification({ inboxNotificationId, userId }),
      ]);

      // Get unread comments (and filter out deleted comments)
      const readAt = inboxNotification.readAt;
      const unreadComments = thread.comments
        .filter((comment) => (readAt ? comment.createdAt > readAt : true))
        .filter((comment) => comment.body !== undefined);

      // No unread comments, therefore notification needed
      if (unreadComments.length === 0) {
        return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
      }

      // Send notifications
      // ...
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return new Response("Could not fetch notification data", { status: 500 });
    }
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

If there are no unread notifications, then we’re choosing not to send an email.

## Generating HTML for the email

Now that we have the comment data, we have one more step before sending the
notifications—formatting each comment’s text, found inside `comment.body`, and
generating the HTML for our email.

<Figure>
  <Image
    src="/assets/comments/email-notification.png"
    alt="An email titled 'New notifications' showing two comments and a link to the thread"
    width={1500}
    height={1000}
  />
</Figure>

By using
[`await stringifyCommentBody`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#stringify-comment-body),
we can convert each comment into plain HTML. In this code snippet, you can see
we’re looping through each comment, and replacing `comment.body` with an HTML
string.

```ts highlight="4,58-76"
import {
  Liveblocks,
  WebhookHandler,
  stringifyCommentBody,
} from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When an inbox notification has been created
  if (event.type === "notification") {
    const { roomId, threadId, inboxNotificationId, userId } = event.data;

    // Check if user has access to room
    if (!__hasRoomAccess__(userId, roomId)) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    try {
      // Get thread and notification
      const [thread, inboxNotification] = await Promise.all([
        liveblocks.getThread({ roomId, threadId }),
        liveblocks.getInboxNotification({ inboxNotificationId, userId }),
      ]);

      // Get unread comments (and filter out deleted comments)
      const readAt = inboxNotification.readAt;
      const unreadComments = thread.comments
        .filter((comment) => (readAt ? comment.createdAt > readAt : true))
        .filter((comment) => comment.body !== undefined);

      // No unread comments, therefore notification needed
      if (unreadComments.length === 0) {
        return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
      }

      // Convert comments to plain HTML and return { body: "<p>...</p>", ...comment } format
      const htmlComments = await Promise.all(
        unreadComments.map((comment) => ({
          body: stringifyCommentBody(comment.body, { format: "html" }),
          ...comment,
        }))
      );

      // Create final HTML for email
      let html = `<h1>New notifications</h1>`;
      for (const comment of htmlComments) {
        html += `
          <div>Comment by ${comment.userId} at ${comment.createdAt}</div>
          ${comment.body}
        `;
      }
      html += `
        <a href="https://my-company.com/room/${roomId}">Go to thread</a>
      `;

      // Send notifications
      // ...
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return new Response("Could not fetch notification data", { status: 500 });
    }
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

This snippet outputs fairly simple formatting, for example it renders a user IDs
(e.g. `@jory.quispe`) instead of a names (e.g. `@Jory Quispe`), but you can
create more complex formatting easily by using more complex
[`stringifyCommentBody`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#stringify-comment-body)
options.

## Send notification emails

Now that the HTML has been generated, we can send the notification emails.
Earlier we retrieved `userId`, the ID of the user that’s receiving the
notification. You can use this to get the user’s email address, before sending
the email itself.

<Banner title="userIds">
  This is the same `userId` that you passed to
  [`resolveUsers`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#resolveUsers) in your
  `liveblocks.config.ts` file.

}
```

## Sending emails with Resend

[Resend](https://resend.com) is a great tool for easily sending emails, and in
this code example, we’re using it to send the notifications to each user. Make
sure to add your API key from the
[Resend dashboard](https://resend.com/overview) before running the code.

```ts highlight="6,8-9,85-95" file="route.ts"
import {
  Liveblocks,
  WebhookHandler,
  stringifyCommentBody,
} from "@liveblocks/node";
import { Resend } from "resend";

// Create Resend client (add your API key)
const resend = new Resend("re_123456789");

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });

## Recap

Great, we’re successfully sending email notifications after new comments are
created! In this guide we’ve learned:

- How to use [webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks) and the
  [`ThreadEmailNotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#ThreadEmailNotificationEvent).
- How to use the [`@liveblocks/node`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node)
  package to unread thread data.
- How to shape a threads into HTML with
  [`stringifyCommentBody`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#stringify-comment-body).
- How to send email notifications with [Resend](https://resend.com).
