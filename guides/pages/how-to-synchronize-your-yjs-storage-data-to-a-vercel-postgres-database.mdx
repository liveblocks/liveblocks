Liveblocks allows you to build collaborative applications with
[Yjs](https://yjs.dev/), which is tightly integrated into our infrastructure.
Using our Webhooks and REST API, you can then retrieve the Yjs document data as
it changes, and store it in your database.

## What we’re building

In this guide we’ll be linking a Yjs application up to a
[Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) database so
that Yjs Storage data is automatically synchronized. This is enabled through the
following:

- [`YDocUpdated`](/docs/platform/webhooks#YDocUpdatedEvent) Webhook event
- [Get Yjs Document](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-ydoc)
  REST API

This guide assumes you already have a Liveblocks Yjs project set up. If haven’t
already got one, you can open our getting started page, select a
[text editor](/docs/get-started/text-editor) or
[code editor](/docs/get-started/code-editor), both of which use Yjs, and come
back after you’re set up.
