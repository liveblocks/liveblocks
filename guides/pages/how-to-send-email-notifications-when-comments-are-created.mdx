    "Learn how to automatically send email notifications when a comment or
    thread is created with Liveblocks Comments."
---

Liveblocks allows you to build a commenting experience with
[Comments](/docs/products/comments). Using our Webhooks and REST API, it’s
possible to send email notifications to users when they’re mentioned in
comments.

## What we’re building

In this guide we’ll be learning how to send comments notifications. We’ll be
looking at how to:

- Trigger events when comment have been created
- Get the users that have been mentioned in the thread
- Send notification emails containing the comment’s text

This is enabled through the following:

- [CommentCreated](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentCreatedEvent) Webhook event
- [Get Comment](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-comment) REST API
- [Get Thread Participants](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-thread-participants)
  REST API

<Banner title="Have a project ready">

This guide assumes you already have a Liveblocks Comments project set up. If
haven’t already got one, you can
[get started with Comments](/docs/get-started/react-comments), and come back
after you’re set up. You could also use our
[basic Comments example](/examples/comments/nextjs-comments).

## Create an endpoint in your project

When a webhook event is triggered, it can send POST request to the back end in
your project, and from within there we can update the database. In this guide,
we’ll be using a Next.js route handler (API endpoint) as an example, but other
frameworks work similarly.

In order to use webhooks, we’ll need to retrieve the `headers` and `body` from
the request. Here’s the basic endpoint we’ll be starting from:

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Handle webhooks and notifications
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

Create this endpoint in your project, and make it available on `localhost` at
the following URL:

```
/api/liveblocks-database-sync
```

### Testing webhooks locally

Running webhooks locally can be difficult, but one way to do this is to use a
tool such as [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) or
[`ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) which allow you to temporarily
put your localhost server online.

If your project is running on `localhost:3000`, you can run the following
command to generate a temporary URL that’s available while your localhost server
is running:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

If you correctly input your IP address, the URL `localtunnel` generates can be
placed into the Liveblocks webhooks dashboard for quick testing.

## Set up webhooks on the Liveblocks dashboard

To use webhooks, you need to your endpoint URL to the webhooks dashboard inside
our Liveblocks project, and tell the webhook to trigger when Storage document
data has changed.

## Verify the webhook request

The [`@liveblocks/node`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) package provides
you with a function that verifies whether the current request is a real webhook
request from your Liveblocks. You can set this up by setting up a
[`WebhookHandler`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#WebhookHandler) and
running [`verifyRequest`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#verifyRequest).

Make sure to add your “Signing Secret” from the Liveblocks dashboard—in a real
project we’d recommend using an environment variable for this.

```ts highlight="1,3-5,11-21"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your signing key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_SIGNING_SECRET";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // Send notifications
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

We can then check we’re receiving the correct type of event, get the data from
the webhook, and handle sending the notification inside there.

```ts highlight="23-29"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your signing key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_SIGNING_SECRET";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When a comment has been created
  if (event.type === "commentCreated") {
    const { roomId, threadId, commentId } = event.data;

    // Send notifications
    // ...
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

We now have the `roomId`, `threadId`, and `commentId` of the created comment,
along with some [other basic data](/docs/platform/webhooks#CommentCreatedEvent).

## Get comment and thread data

The next step is to use the
[Get Comment API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-comment) to
retrieve the full comment data. To do this, we’ll create a utils file with a
helper function that takes the IDs from the webhook.

```ts file="utils.ts"
import { CommentData } from "@liveblocks/client";

// Add your secret key from your project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";

type GetComment = {
  roomId: string;
  threadId: string;
  commentId: string;
};

// Get comment data from Liveblocks REST API
export async function getComment({
  roomId,
  threadId,
  commentId,
}: GetComment): Promise<CommentData> {
  const url = `https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/${roomId}/threads/${threadId}/comments/${commentId}`;
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_SECRET}` },
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Problem accessing Liveblocks Comment APIs");
  }

  // Your comment data
  return (await response.json()) as CommentData;
}
```

We’ll also need to use the
[Get Thread Participants API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-thread-participants),
which returns a list of every user that has been mentioned in the current
thread—we’ll be sending a notification to each of these.

<Banner title="Threads vs comments">
  Note that a thread is different to a comment—each thread contains a list of
  comments. When you create a thread, you also create the first comment in a
  thread.
</Banner>

```ts file="utils.ts" highlight="9-30"
import { CommentData } from "@liveblocks/client";

// Add your secret key from your project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "sk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

// getCommentData function
// ...

type GetParticipants = {
  roomId: string;
  threadId: string;
};

// Get thread participants from Liveblocks REST API
export async function getParticipants({
  roomId,
  threadId,
}: GetParticipants): Promise<string[]> {
  const url = `https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/${roomId}/threads/${threadId}/participants`;
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_SECRET}` },
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Problem accessing Liveblocks Comment APIs");
  }

  // Your thread participants
  return (await response.json()).participantIds as string[];
}
```

Now we’ve created these functions, we can import them into our endpoint to
retrieve the necessary data.

```ts highlight="28-40"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";
import { getComment, getParticipants } from "./utils";

// Add your signing key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_SIGNING_SECRET";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When a comment has been created
  if (event.type === "commentCreated") {
    const { roomId, threadId, commentId } = event.data;

    try {
      // Get comment data and participants
      const [comment, participants] = await Promise.all([
        getComment({ roomId, threadId, commentId }),
        getParticipants({ roomId, threadId }),
      ]);

      // Send notifications
      // ...
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return new Response("Could not fetch comment data", { status: 500 });
    }
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Send notifications

## Formatting a comment’s body

The text of the comment is stored as an array of paragraphs, inside
`comment.body`, each containing an array of elements. If we’d

[send notification for each]

[show resend code example in a collapsible]

[format comment data]
