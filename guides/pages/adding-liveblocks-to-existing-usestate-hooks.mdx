You can easily add Liveblocks to an existing `useState` hook by broadcasting and
listening to events.

```ts
import { useState } from "react";
import { useBroadcastEvent, useEventListener } from "./liveblocks.config";

function useCustomState() {
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  const broadcast = useBroadcastEvent();

  // Update useState and broadcast an event
  const setStateAndBroadcast = (newValue) => {
    setState(newValue);
    broadcast({ type: "STATE_UPDATE", data: newValue });
  };

  // Listen for the broadcast event
  useEventListener(({ event }) => {
    if (event.type === "STATE_UPDATE") {
      setState(event.data);
    }
  });

  return [state, setStateAndBroadcast];
}
```
