In this guide, we’ll be learning how to use Liveblocks Storage with Zustand
using the APIs from the [`@liveblocks/zustand`][] package.

This guide assumes you already have Liveblocks set up into your Zustand store.
If you don’t make sure to follow
[these quick steps to get started](/docs/get-started/zustand) first.

## Sync and persist the state across client [#storage-intro]

As opposed to `presence`, some collaborative features require that every user
interacts with the same piece of state. For example, in Google Docs, it is the
paragraphs, headings, images in the document. In Figma, it’s all the shapes that
make your design. That’s what we call the room’s “storage”.

Try the [Liveblocks DevTools extension](/devtools) to inspect and debug your
collaborative experiences as you build them, in realtime.

The room’s storage is a conflicts-free state that multiple users can edit at the
same time. It is persisted to our backend even after everyone leaves the room.
Liveblocks provides custom data structures inspired by
[CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) that
can be nested to create the state that you want.

- [`LiveObject`][] - Similar to JavaScript object. If multiple users update the
  same property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
  servers is the winner.
- [`LiveList`][] - An ordered collection of items synchronized across clients.
  Even if multiple users add/remove/move elements simultaneously, LiveList will
  solve the conflicts to ensure everyone sees the same collection of items.
- [`LiveMap`][] - Similar to a JavaScript Map. If multiple users update the same
  property simultaneously, the last modification received by the Liveblocks
  servers is the winner.

When using our Zustand integration you cannot interact directly with these data
structures. Our middleware synchronizes your store with our data structures
based on the `storageMapping` configuration.

Here is an example to explain how it works under the hood. Imagine you have the
following store:

```ts file="src/store.ts" highlight="6-8,20-22"
/* ...client setup */

const useStore = create<WithLiveblocks<State>>()(
  liveblocks(
    (set) => ({
      firstName: "Marie",
      lastName: "Curie",
      discoveries: ["Polonium", "Radium"],

      setFirstName: (firstName) => set({ firstName }),
      setLastName: (lastName) => set({ lastName }),
      addDiscovery: (discovery) =>
        set((state) => ({
          discoveries: state.discoveries.concat([discovery]),
        })),
    }),
    {
      client,
      storageMapping: {
        firstName: true,
        lastName: true,
        discoveries: true,
      },
    }
  )
);
```

With this setup, the room's `storage` root is:

```ts
const root = new LiveObject({
  firstName: "Marie",
  lastName: "Curie",
  discoveries: new LiveList(["Polonium", "Radium"]),
});
```

If you update your store by calling `setFirstName("Pierre")`, the middleware
will do `root.set("firstName", "Pierre")` for you and update the store of all
the users currently connected to the room. The middleware compares the previous
state and the new state to detect changes and patch our data structures
accordingly.

The reverse process happens when receiving updates from other clients; the
middleware patches your immutable state.

When entering a room with `liveblocks.enterRoom`, the middleware fetches the
room's storage from our server and patches your store. If this is the first time
you're entering a room, the storage will be initialized with the current value
in your Zustand state, typically your initial state.
