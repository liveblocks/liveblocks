In February 2026, we released a new back-end engine that powers
[Liveblocks Storage](/docs/ready-made-features/multiplayer/sync-engine/liveblocks-storage)
under the hood. It’s a major improvement over the previous storage engine, and
in future, it’ll be the default.

## What are the benefits?

[Add your titles and info here]

## How to enable it

Enable the new Storage engine for new rooms by setting your `engine` option to
`2`.

```tsx
<LiveblocksProvider id="my-new-room" engine={2}>
  {children}
</LiveblocksProvider>
```
