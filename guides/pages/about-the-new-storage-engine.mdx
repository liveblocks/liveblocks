Since v3.14, rooms can be powered by our new v2 Storage engine—a ground-up
rearchitecture that removes server-side memory limits, enabling faster initial
loads and support for much larger documents. Switching is **seamless and
requires no code changes**. Rooms on v1 or v2 behave identically from your app's
perspective—Presence, Broadcasts, Liveblocks Storage, and Yjs Storage all work
the same way.

You can now opt in to v2 to try it out and give us feedback. Soon it will become
the default for everyone.

## What are the benefits?

The main architectural leap of v2 is that the Liveblocks server no longer needs
to keep the entire document in memory. In v1, large documents put memory
pressure on our edge workers, which are limited in capacity. A 50 MiB document,
including its overhead, could easily cause an OOM crash in an edge worker on the
v1 engine, in turn causing the room to become inaccessible.

Rooms on the v2 Storage engine now stream their document data directly from our
persisted storage layer, keeping only minimal data in memory. Conflict
resolution and mutations happen directly in the storage layer too.

This enables arbitrarily large documents—server memory is no longer the
bottleneck (browser memory, network speed, or your app’s rendering performance
might now be).

Initial load time will be faster, especially for larger documents: the server
can start streaming immediately without buffering, and our wire protocol has
been compacted to reduce transmission overhead.

Several [previously documented platform limits](/docs/platform/limits) have been
raised significantly for rooms on the v2 engine:

| Item                    | v1 limit | v2 limit |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Broadcast event message | 1 MB     | 32 MB    |
| `LiveObject`            | 128 kB   | 2 MB     |
| `LiveMap` value         | 128 kB   | 2 MB     |
| `LiveList` value        | 128 kB   | 2 MB     |

## How to enable it

The engine is assigned at room creation time and cannot be changed afterward.

1. Upgrade to v3.14+: `npx liveblocks@latest upgrade`
2. Opt-in to v2 (see options below)

### Per-room opt-in

Specify the `engine` option when entering a room. This only affects new rooms—if
the room already exists, the room stays on its original engine version.

With `RoomProvider`:

```tsx
<RoomProvider id="my-new-room" engine={2}>
  {children}
</RoomProvider>
```

With vanilla client:

```tsx
const { room, leave } = client.enterRoom("my-new-room", { engine: 2 });
```

### Dashboard opt-in

Alternatively, you can opt-in without code changes directly from your
[Liveblocks dashboard](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard):

1. Click Settings
2. Toggle "Enable v2 Storage engine for new rooms"

This is equivalent to setting `engine={2}` on all new rooms going forward.
**Note: this toggle affects all projects in your account.**

### Warning

At the moment, rooms on v2 aren't being backed up by us yet. This will be
implemented before v3.14 is officially release.

### Migrating existing rooms

Eventually, we will transparently migrate all existing room data from the v1 to
the v2 Storage engine, and the explicit opt-in `engine` option will no longer
have an effect, but we will announce this ahead of time. This process will be a
seamless and uninterrupted continuation for rooms, and require no action on your
part.
