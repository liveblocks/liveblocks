    within Node.js"

In realtime applications, Liveblocks Storage is generally modified from the
browser with [`useMutation`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMutation)
or through
[conflict-free data methods](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Storage).
However, it can be useful to modify your realtime storage from server-side
Node.js too.

## What we’re doing

<Banner title="Make sure you’re on the latest version" type="info">

This guide assumes you’re using the latest version of `@liveblocks/node`.

In this guide, we’ll demonstrate how to easily modify storage from the server.
We’ll do this using `@liveblocks/node`.

## Start modifying storage

We can now start modify storage from the server!

```ts file="route.ts"
// 1. Creating a node client (centrally)
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({
  secret: "{{SECRET_KEY}}",
});

export async function POST() {
  console.log("Updating storage");

  // 2. Mutate storage
  await liveblocks.mutateStorage(
    "my-room",

    ({ root }) => {
      root.get("list").push("item3");
    }
  );

  console.log("Storage update complete!");
}
```

## Account for the service user in your app

Using this method, there will not be a user showing up in your connected
client’s “others” list, so there is nothing special you need to do to filter
those out.
