    "Learn how to filter for certain threads using their metadata with our query
    language"

When using Comments and retrieving threads with our REST API, it’s possible to
filter for specific threads using
[custom metadata](/docs/ready-made-features/comments/metadata) and our custom
query language. This enables the
[Get Threads REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-threads)
to have filtering that works the same as with
[`useThreads`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useThreads) and
[`liveblocks.getThreads`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-rooms-roomId-threads).

## Query language

You can filter threads by their metadata, allowing you to select for certain
properties, values, or even for string prefixes. Filters can be combined using
`AND` logic.

```js
// Resolved threads
resolved:true

// Threads with { status: 'open' } string metadata
metadata['status']:'open'

// Threads with `{ org }` string metadata that starts with "liveblocks:"
metadata['org']^'liveblocks:'

// Threads with { priority: 3 } number metadata
metadata['priority']:3

// Threads with { pinned: false } boolean metadata
metadata['pinned']:false

// Threads without a `color` property
metadata['color']:null

// Combine queries with AND
resolved:true AND metadata['priority']:3

// A more complex combination
metadata['status']:'closed' AND metadata['org']^'liveblocks:'
```

The `AND` is optional and can actually be omitted, but we’re using it here for
clarity.

### How to use

To use the query language with the
[REST API](/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-threads) pass
your query string to the `query` parameter. For example, given this query:

```js
metadata['status']:'open' AND metadata['priority']:3
```

Encode it, and add it to the `query` parameter:

```
https://api.liveblocks.io/v2/rooms/{roomId}/threads?query=metadata%5B'status'%5D%3A'open'%20AND%20metadata%5B'priority'%5D%3A3
```
