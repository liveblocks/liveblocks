In this guide, we’ll be learning how to use Liveblocks multiplayer undo/redo
with Zustand using the APIs from the [`@liveblocks/zustand`][] package.

This guide assumes you already have Liveblocks set up into your Zustand store.
If you don’t make sure to follow
[these quick steps to get started](/docs/get-started/zustand) first.

## Multiplayer undo/redo [#undo-redo]

Implementing undo/redo when multiple users can edit the app state simultaneously
is quite complex!

**When only one user can edit the app state, undo/redo acts like a "time
machine"**; undo/redo replaces the current app state with an app state that was
already be seen by the user.

When multiple users are involved, undo or redo can lead to an app state that no
one has seen before. For example, let's imagine a design tool with two users
editing the same circle.

- Initial state => `{ radius: "10px", color: "yellow" }`
- User A sets the `color` to `blue` => `{ radius: "10px", color: "blue" }`
- User B sets the `radius` to `20px` => `{ radius: "20px", color: "blue" }`
- User A realizes that it preferred the circle in yellow and undoes **its last
  modification** => `{ radius: "20px", color: "yellow" }`

A yellow circle with a radius of 20px in a completely new state. **Undo/redo in
a multiplayer app does not act like a "time machine"; it only undoes local
operation**.

The good news is that [`room.history.undo`][] and [`room.history.redo`][] takes
that complexity out of your hands so you can focus on the core features of your
app.

Access these two functions from your store like below so you can easily bind
them to keyboard events (⌘+Z/⌘+⇧+Z on Mac and Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y on Windows) or undo
and redo buttons in your application..

```tsx
import useStore from "../store";

function YourComponent() {
  const undo = useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.room?.history.undo);
  const redo = useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.room?.history.redo);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={undo}>Undo</button>
      <button onClick={redo}>Redo</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Pause and resume history [#pause-resume]

Some applications require skipping intermediate states from the undo/redo
history. Let's consider a design tool; when a user drags a rectangle, the
intermediate rectangle positions should not be part of the undo/redo history.
But they should be shared with the rest of the room to create a great
experience.

[`room.history.pause`][] and [`room.history.resume`][] lets you skip these
intermediate states. To go back to our design tool example, the sequence of
calls would look like that:

- User presses the rectangle
- Call `room.history.pause` to skip future operations from the history
- User drags the rectangle
- User release the rectangle
- Call `room.history.resume`

At this point, if the user calls `room.history.undo`, the rectangle will go back
to its initial position.

```tsx
import useStore from "../store";

const pause = useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.room?.history.pause);
const resume = useStore((state) => state.liveblocks.room?.history.resume);
```
