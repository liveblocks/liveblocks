When adding Liveblocks to [Astro](https://astro.build) apps, it's recommended to
use
[`client:only`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientonly)
with your components. This is recommended because Liveblocks only needs on the
client, and in Astro, you may run into bundling issues if the app is rendered on
both the server and client.

## Example

Here's an example of `client:only` used with various frameworks:

```astro
---
import SvelteInput from "../components/SvelteInput.svelte";
import ReactInput from "../components/ReactInput.tsx";
import VueInput from "../components/VueInput.vue";
---

<main>
  <ReactInput client:only="react" />
  <SvelteInput client:only="svelte" />
  <VueInput client:only="vue" />
</main>
```

## Not required with .astro components

Note that when using `.astro` components and the `<script>` tag, `client:only`
is not necessary, because it always runs on the client:

```astro
---
import VanillaInput from "../components/VanillaInput.astro";
---

<main>
  <VanillaInput />
</main>
```

```html
<script>
  import { room, myLiveObject } from "../liveblocksSetup.js";

  const input = document.querySelector("#vanilla");

  room.subscribe(myLiveObject, (updatedLiveObject) => {
    input.value = updatedLiveObject.get("text");
  });

  room.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
    myLiveObject.set("text", e.target.value);
  });
</script>

<input id="vanilla" type="text" onClick="this.select()" />
```

## Using @liveblocks/react with Astro

Note that when using our React package with Astro, `RoomProvider` does not work
in nested `.astro` files, as each component is a separate "island", and cannot
see the context in another island. Each React root in `.astro` files is like a
new React app, and will need its own `RoomProvider`.
