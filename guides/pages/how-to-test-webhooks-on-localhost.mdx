    "Learn how to test Liveblocks webhooks on your local system using
    localtunnel or ngrok."
---

Testing webhooks on your local system can be difficult, but there are ways to
make it possible using tools such as
[`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) and
[`ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok).

## Create an endpoint in your project

The first step in testing webhooks is making sure you have an API endpoint set
up in your project. This is the endpoint that’ll receive the webhook event from
Liveblocks.

In order to use webhooks, we’ll need to retrieve the `headers` and `body` from
the request. Here’s the basic endpoint we’ll be starting from:

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Handle webhooks
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

Create this endpoint in your project, and make it available on `localhost` at
the following URL:

```
/api/liveblocks-webhook
```

## Testing webhooks locally

Tools such as `localtunnel` and `ngrok` allow you to temporarily place your
localhost server online, by providing you with a temporary URL. Let’s take a
look at these two options.

### localtunnel

[`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) allows you to get
started without signing up. If your project is running on `localhost:3000`, you
can run the following `localtunnel` command to generate your URL, which will
stay online while your localhost server is running:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

`localtunnel` generates a base URL that can be placed into the Liveblocks
webhooks dashboard for quick testing. To use this, take the full address of your
webhook endpoint, and replace the domain in your `localhost` address with the
generated URL.

```shell
# Take your local URL
http://localhost:3000/api/liveblocks-webhook

# Replace localhost with the generated domain, then copy it
https://my-localtunnel-url.loca.lt/api/liveblocks-webhook
```

You now have a URL that can be used in the webhooks dashboard.

### ngrok

[`ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) requires you to sign up and
install, but it has more features and is simpler to use after you’ve created an
account. If your project is running on `localhost:3000`, you can run the
following `ngrok` command to generate your URL, which will stay online while
your localhost server is running:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

`ngrok` generates a base URL that can be placed into the Liveblocks webhooks
dashboard for quick testing. To use this, take the full address of your webhook
endpoint, and replace the domain in your `localhost` address with the generated
URL.

```shell
# Take your local URL
http://localhost:3000/api/liveblocks-webhook

# Replace localhost with the generated domain, then copy it
https://my-localtunnel-url.loca.lt/api/liveblocks-webhook
```

You now have a URL that can be used in the webhooks dashboard.

## Set up webhooks on the Liveblocks dashboard

To use webhooks, you need to pass your endpoint URL to the webhooks dashboard
inside your Liveblocks project, and tell the webhook to trigger on any specific
[webhook events](/docs/platform/webhooks#Liveblocks-events).

      From the [Liveblocks dashboard](/dashboard), navigate to the project you’d

    Enter the URL of the endpoint. In a production app this will be the real
    endpoint, but for now enter your `localtunnel` or `ngrok` URL from earlier.

    You can filter for any specific [webhook events](/docs/platform/webhooks#Liveblocks-events) here, in case you’d only like to listen to certain types.

## Verify the webhook request

It’s recommended to verify that your webhook requests have come from Liveblocks,
and the [`@liveblocks/node`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) package
provides you with a function that will verify this for you. You can set this up
by creating a
[`WebhookHandler`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#WebhookHandler) and
running [`verifyRequest`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#verifyRequest).

Make sure to add your "Webhook secret key" from the Liveblocks dashboard—in a
real project we’d recommend using an environment variable for this.

```ts highlight="1,3-5,11-21"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // Use webhook event
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

The webhook has now been verified!

## Use your webhook event

From this point on, you can use the webhook event as you like. Here’s a
[Comments](/docs/ready-made-features/comments) example, showing you how to fetch
a new thread after it’s just been created.

```ts highlight="2,8-10,28-37"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";
import { Liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

// Add your secret key from a project's API keys dashboard
const API_SECRET = "{{SECRET_KEY}}";
const liveblocks = new Liveblocks({ secret: API_SECRET });

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // When a new thread has been created
  if (event.type === "threadCreated") {
    const { roomId, threadId } = event.data;

    // Fetch new thread
    const thread = await liveblocks.getThread({ roomId, threadId });

    // Use thread
    // ...
  }

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```
