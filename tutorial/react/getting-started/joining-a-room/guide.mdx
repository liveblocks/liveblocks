Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people can
collaborate. To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be connected
to the same room.

### RoomProvider

Remember how we exported [`RoomProvider`][] from [liveblocks.config.ts][]? This
is the component we’ll be using to connect to a room, and it also enables us to
use the Liveblocks React hooks. [`RoomProvider`][] has two required properties:

1.  `id` - The unique name of the room, a string.
2.  `initialPresence` - We’ll learn about this on the next page.

Switch to [App.tsx][] and return a [`RoomProvider`][] component with the
`roomId` string, and an empty object as the `initialPresence`.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/App.tsx"
return (
  <RoomProvider id={roomId} initialPresence={{}}>
    <Room />
  </RoomProvider>
);
```

We’ll be building our custom real-time app inside [Room.tsx][], so we’re adding
this component as a child.

### Displaying a loading screen

Because we’re exporting the suspense version of our hooks, we can easily add a
loading screen using [`ClientSideSuspense`][] from `@liveblocks/react`. To do
this, pass `<Room>`, and include a loading `fallback`:

```tsx highlight="3-5" modifyTutorialFile="/App.tsx"
return (
  <RoomProvider id={roomId} initialPresence={{}}>
    <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
      {() => <Room />}
    </ClientSideSuspense>
  </RoomProvider>
);
```

If you’re using a framework without server-side rendering, using `Suspense` from
React works too.

You can place this component anywhere inside your app, for example around an
avatar stack—it doesn’t have to sit at the top-level. Add the code and click
refresh in the preview window to see a brief loading message.
