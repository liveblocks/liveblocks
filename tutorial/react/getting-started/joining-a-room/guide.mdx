Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people can
collaborate. To create a realtime experience, multiple users must be connected
to the same room.

### RoomProvider

[`RoomProvider`][] is the component we’ll be using to connect to a room, and it
requires an `id` prop, which represents the unique name of the room. Switch to
[App.tsx][] and return a [`RoomProvider`][] component with the `roomId` string.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/App.tsx"
return (
  <LiveblocksProvider publicApiKey={publicApiKey}>
    <RoomProvider id={roomId}>
      <Room />
    </RoomProvider>
  </LiveblocksProvider>
);
```

We’ll be building our custom realtime app inside [Room.tsx][], so we’re passing
this component as a child.

### Suspense and loading screens

We recommend using [Suspense](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#Suspense)
when building with Liveblocks, as it makes it simpler to use our hooks. This
also makes it easy to display a loading screen around components by using
[`ClientSideSuspense`][] from the `@liveblocks/react` package. To do this, pass
`<Room>` as a child, and include a loading `fallback`:

```tsx highlight="4,6" modifyTutorialFile="/App.tsx"
return (
  <LiveblocksProvider publicApiKey={publicApiKey}>
    <RoomProvider id={roomId}>
      <ClientSideSuspense fallback={<div>Loading…</div>}>
        <Room />
      </ClientSideSuspense>
    </RoomProvider>
  </LiveblocksProvider>
);
```

You can place this component anywhere inside your app, for example around an
avatar stack—it doesn’t have to sit at the top-level. Add the code and click
refresh in the preview window to see a brief loading message.
