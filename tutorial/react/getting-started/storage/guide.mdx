Storage allows us to create persistent data that multiple users can edit
simultaneously. This is ideal for storing realtime document state, such as
shapes on a canvas, paragraphs in a text editor, or cells in a spreadsheet.

Storage is part of our
[Sync Datastore](/docs/ready-made-features/sync-datastore) product.

### Conflict-free data types

To build applications using storage, you can make use of our conflict-free data
types. Each type is similar to a JavaScript counterpart:

- [`LiveObject`][] - JavaScript Object
- [`LiveList`][] - JavaScript Array
- [`LiveMap`][] - JavaScript Map

These data types can be combined and nested, to create a realtime data structure
that automatically updates when multiple users modify data at the same time,
whilst handling any conflicts along the way.

### Defining storage

Let’s imagine we were storing some data about a person, for example their name
and age.

```js
person: { name: "Marie", age: 30 }
```

To add this to storage, first we must define our types. Open
[liveblocks.config.ts][] and use a [`LiveObject`][] with the structure for
`person` as a generic.

```ts modifyTutorialFile="/liveblocks.config.ts"
// Storage type
Storage: {
  person: LiveObject<{
    name: string;
    age: number;
  }>;
}
```

Now we’ve defined the type, we can switch to [App.tsx][] and add an
`intialStorage` value, that is used when the room’s storage is created. We can
match the `Storage` type by creating a new [`LiveObject`][].

```tsx highlight="3-5" modifyTutorialFile="/App.tsx"
<RoomProvider
  id={roomId}
  initialStorage={{
    person: new LiveObject({ name: "Marie", age: 30 }),
  }}
>
```

Using a LiveObject like this, instead of a regular JavaScript object, allows us
to use its realtime features. For example multiple people can edit the
properties of a LiveObject at the same time without overriding the whole object.

### Displaying storage

To use this realtime data in your app, we can import a hook named
[`useStorage`][]. This hook allows us to select part of our storage, before
returning its value, and automatically updating on realtime changes.

```tsx
// { person: "Marie", age: 30 }
const person = useStorage((root) => root.person);
```

Each realtime data structure is converted to an _immutable copy_ of its
JavaScript counterpart, so a `LiveObject` becomes a regular JavaScript object.
We can implement this ourselves by adding the following code to [Room.tsx][]:

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/Room.tsx"
import { useStorage } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";

export function Room() {
  const person = useStorage((root) => root.person);

  return <div>Person: {JSON.stringify(person)}</div>;
}
```

If we weren’t using `suspense` in our config file, `person` would return `null`
until it was loaded, and we’d have to check for this. We’re using `suspense`
here, so this isn’t a worry.

and you should now be seeing `person`! On the next page we’ll be updating
storage.
