Most collaborative features rely on each user having their own temporary state,
which is then shared with others. For example, in an app using multiplayer
cursors, the location of each user’s cursor will be their state. This state
could also be used for a typing indicator, or to show a user’s current
selection. In Liveblocks, we call this [presence](/presence).

We can use _presence_ to hold any object that we wish to share with others. An
example would be the coordinates of a user’s cursor on screen:

```js
cursor: { x: 256, y: 367 }
```

### Setting up presence

To start using presence, let’s define a type for it in [liveblocks.config.ts][].
We’ll use the format above for displaying cursors, with the addition of `null`
to represent an off-screen cursor.

```ts modifyTutorialFile="/liveblocks.config.ts"
// Presence type
type Presence = {
  cursor: { x: number; y: number } | null;
};
```

<Banner title="Defining types">

You’ll notice that at the bottom of the file, we’ve already added `Presence` to
`createRoomContext`. Because we’re exporting our hooks from here, all our types
will automatically propagate through our entire app.

The last step in setting up presence is setting an initial value. Switch to
[App.tsx][] and pass `cursor: null` to [`RoomProvider`][]—no one starts with
their cursor on-screen.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/App.tsx"
<RoomProvider id={roomId} initialPresence={{ cursor: null }}>
```

### Displaying presence

To display the current user’s presence, we’ll add [`useMyPresence`][] to
[Room.tsx][], and quickly display its value, similarly to `useState`.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/Room.tsx"
import { useMyPresence } from "./liveblocks.config";

export function Room() {
  const [myPresence, updateMyPresence] = useMyPresence();

  return <div>Cursor: {JSON.stringify(myPresence.cursor)}</div>;
}
```

Great! **Press the refresh button in the preview window** to reload
`initialPresence`, and you should now be seeing `Cursor: null`! On the next page
we’ll be creating live cursors with presence.
