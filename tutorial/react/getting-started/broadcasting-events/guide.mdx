Another key feature of Liveblocks is the ability to
[broadcast custom events](/broadcast) to other users. Events are ephemeral, and
are sent to all users currently connected to the room, which makes them useful
for:

- Creating state controls, for example “next/previous slide” buttons in
  presentations
- Letting other users know when to revalidate data after a change
- Sending short-lived chat messages to other users

On this page, we’ll be using events to send
[toast notifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_notification) to
other users.

### Setting up types

The first step in broadcasting events is setting up your types. Let’s navigate
to [liveblocks.config.ts][] and create a `RoomEvent` type for our toasts.
`RoomEvent` represents the object that will be broadcast to other users
currently connected to the room. We’ll give it a `type` along with a `message`
that can appear in the toast notification.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/liveblocks.config.ts"
// Event types
RoomEvent: {
  type: "TOAST";
  message: string;
}
```

If your app uses multiple event types, you can make `RoomEvent` a union type.

### Broadcasting the events

Events can be broadcast to other users with the [`useBroadcastEvent`][] hook.
Switch to [Room.tsx][] and add the hook, imported from our config file.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/Room.tsx"
// Broadcast event hook
const broadcast = useBroadcastEvent();
```

In the `onClick` event, pass an object to `broadcast` that matches the
`RoomEvent` type specified above—this is how we send an event to other users.

```tsx highlight="5" modifyTutorialFile="/Room.tsx"
return (
  <button
    onClick={() =>
      // Broadcast toast event
      broadcast({ type: "TOAST", message: "Event received!" })
    }
  >
    Broadcast event
  </button>
);
```

### Listening for events

We’re now _sending_ an event, but we’re not _listening_ for any. Import
[`useEventListener`][] and add it to the component. In the callback, we’re
checking if the received event is a toast notification, and if it is, we’re
calling a function that sends a toast notification with the message.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/Room.tsx"
// Listen for incoming events
useEventListener(({ event }) => {
  if (event.type === "TOAST") {
    toast(event.message);
  }
});
```

Try pressing the button to see other users receive toast notifications! You can
also change the `message` and see an updated notification appear.
