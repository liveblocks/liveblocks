To use Liveblocks in React, you need to install our packages to your project.
We’ve already installed the packages in this guide, but this is how you’d do it
in your own project:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react
```

After installing the packages, you can initialize a Liveblocks project with a
config file, which we’ve already done on this page:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --init
```

This file is named [liveblocks.config.ts][], and it’s used to define your
TypeScript types.

### Setting up a client

The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which will be
responsible for communicating with our back end. You can do this by adding
[`LiveblocksProvider`][], and passing your public API key.

```tsx
<LiveblocksProvider publicApiKey="pk_s9bs7fl...">
```

Every Liveblocks application needs to be nested inside this. Open [App.tsx][],
set up [`LiveblocksProvider`][], and return the `CollaborativeApplication`
component inside.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/App.tsx"
return (
  <LiveblocksProvider publicApiKey={publicApiKey}>
    <CollaborativeApplication />
  </LiveblocksProvider>
);
```

You should now be seeing a demo application!

### Authentication

Ordinarily, you’d find your API keys on the [dashboard](/dashboard/apikeys), but
for this tutorial we’re providing you with a temporary key. In most production
apps we recommend setting up Liveblocks on the server with your secret key, but
for now, the public key is fine. Learn more under
[authentication](/docs/authentication).
