On the previous page we learned to update presence with our cursor
location—let’s use it to render live cursors.

### Getting others’ presence

Switch to [Room.tsx][] and add the imported [`useOthers`][] hook to your
component.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/Room.tsx"
// Get list of other users
const others = useOthers();
```

[`useOthers`][] returns a list of information about the _other_ users currently
online, such as presence. For example, you can find the first other user’s
cursor position here:

```tsx
// { cursor: null }
others[0].presence;
```

### Rendering the cursors

To render the cursors, we first need a cursor component. If you look inside
[Cursor.tsx][] you’ll find a simple component that does this using `x` and `y`
coordinates.

```tsx
<Cursor x={141} y={252} />
```

To draw them, we can map through `others`, filtering for any cursors that are
equal to `null` (therefore off-screen), and render each on-screen cursor. Switch
back to [Room.tsx][] and return the following code.

```tsx highlight="8-16" modifyTutorialFile="/Room.tsx"
return (
  <div
    style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}
    onPointerMove={handlePointerMove}
    onPointerLeave={handlePointerLeave}
  >
    Cursor: {JSON.stringify(myPresence.cursor)}
    {others
      .filter((other) => other.presence.cursor !== null)
      .map(({ connectionId, presence }) => (
        <Cursor
          key={connectionId}
          x={presence.cursor.x}
          y={presence.cursor.y}
        />
      ))}
  </div>
);
```

`connectionId` is a unique number for each online user that can be used as a
key.

After adding this, hover over the preview windows to see functioning live
cursors!

### Throttle rate

We can actually make these cursors even smoother, by requesting Liveblocks send
more frequent updates. We can do this in [App.tsx][] by adding the `throttle`
prop `LiveblocksProvider`.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/App.tsx"
<LiveblocksProvider publicApiKey={publicApiKey} throttle={16}>
```

**Press the refresh button in the preview window** to reload the client, and you
should now be seeing smoother cursors!

The default throttle rate is 100ms, and above we’re decreasing it to 16ms. This
is equivalent to a 60fps animation.

### Other uses

Presence isn’t only used for cursors, there are also a number of other different
applications such as:

- [Online avatars](/examples/live-avatar-stack/)
- [Selection or location indicators](/examples/live-form-selection)
- [“User currently typing...” messages](/examples/collaborative-todo-list)
