Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks hooks. The
first we’ll add is [`useOthers`][], a hook that provides information about which
_other_ users are connected to the room.

### Suspense hooks

From this point on, we’ll be using the Suspense version of our hooks and
components, which we’ve enabled by adding [`ClientSideSuspense`][] to
[App.tsx][]. To use them, export from `@liveblocks/react/suspense`.

### useOthers

Switch to [Room.tsx][] and import the suspense version of hook—we’ll be building
our realtime app in this component.

```ts highlight="3" modifyTutorialFile="/Room.tsx"
import { useOthers } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";
```

The [`useOthers`][] hook returns a list of users that are currently online,
along with their data. We can access `.length` to return the current online user
count.

```tsx modifyTutorialFile="/Room.tsx"
// Add useOthers
const others = useOthers();
const userCount = others.length;
```

Add these lines to [Room.tsx][] to see the beginnings of an online app! We’ll be
coming back to [`useOthers`][] again shortly after learning about _presence_.
