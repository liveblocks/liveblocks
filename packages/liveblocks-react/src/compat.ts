// If you import the hooks from this module directly, you cannot benefit from
// associating them with your custom Presence and/or Storage types. Our best
// shot is to let TypeScript know that these are JSON-serializable objects, but
// we know nothing about it until you provide your own custom types.
//
// The recommended practice is to switch your imports from:
//
//    import { RoomProvider, useOthers, useList, ... } from '@liveblocks/react';
//
// To:
//
//    import { createHooks } from '@liveblocks/react';
//    const { RoomProvider, useOthers, useList, ... } = createHooks<MyPresence, MyStorage>();
//                                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^
//                                                                  Provide these types yourself!
