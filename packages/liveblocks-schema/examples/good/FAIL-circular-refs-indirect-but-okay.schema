# This indirect self-referential type should be perfectly fine. It's easy to
# support this at the parser level, but not so much for the runtime
# implementation, see https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks.io/issues/910
#
# We should ideally support this again later.

type Storage { moo: Moo }
type Moo { boo?: Boo }
type Boo { zoo: Zoo }
type Zoo { moo: Moo }  # Cycle here, but the optionality breaks the ref cycle, so it's fine
