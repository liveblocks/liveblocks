# Week 51 (2024-12-20)

## v2.15.0

### `@liveblocks/react`

- **Breaking**: Drop support for React 17 (and 16). If you’re unable to upgrade
  React to 18 or higher, you can still continue to use Liveblocks 2.14.0, which
  is the last version to support React versions lower than 18.

### All packages

- The published target for all Liveblocks packages is now ES2022 (up from
  ES2020). This should have a positive impact on your bundle size[\*].

- Various internal refactorings and code cleanup.

[\*] If you bundle for the browser, this should not be a problem, as all major
browsers support ES2022. If however you're specifically targeting very old
browsers (mostly IE), then you may need to configure your bundler (Webpack,
rollup, esbuild, etc) to also down-compile code from dependencies inside
`node_modules` for you, if you aren't already.

## Website

- New blog post: [A better way to email your users about unread content](https://liveblocks.io/blog/a-better-way-to-email-your-users-about-unread-content).

## Examples

- Adjusted email templates to allow switching the logo more easily.
- Next.js Starter Kit improvements:
  - Renaming a document updates it immediately for everyone else.
  - Clicking outside of the rename input saves the new name.
  - Added tldraw's dark mode.
  - Added option to filter for canvas in the room listing.
  - Upgraded Liveblocks.
  - Fixed a z-index problem and added a hover style.

## Documentation

- [Upgrade guide for 2.15](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/2.15).
- Added links to email templates in guides and API reference.

# Week 46 (2024-11-15)

## v2.12.0

This release adds support for tracking synchronization status of pending local
changes for any part of Liveblocks. Whether you use Storage, Text Editors,
Threads, or Notifications. If the client’s sync status is `synchronized`, it
means all local pending changes have been persisted by our servers. If there are
pending local changes in any part of Liveblocks you’re using, then the client’s
sync status will be `synchronizing`.

Also, we’re introducing a way to prevent browser tabs from being closed while
local changes are not yet synchronized. To opt-in to this protection, enable
`preventUnsavedChanges` option on the client:

- In React: `<LiveblocksProvider preventUnsavedChanges />`
- Otherwise: `createClient({ preventUnsavedChanges: true })`

### `@liveblocks/client`

- Add new API
  [`client.getSyncStatus()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.getSyncStatus)
  method.
- Add new client config option:
  [`preventUnsavedChanges`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#prevent-users-losing-unsaved-changes).
- Expose `ToImmutable<T>` helper type.

### `@liveblocks/react`

- Add new hook
  [`useSyncStatus`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useSyncStatus)
  that can be used to tell whether Liveblocks is synchronizing local changes to
  the server. Useful to display a "Saving..." spinner in your application, when
  used with `useSyncStatus({ smooth: true })`.
- Add new `LiveblocksProvider` prop:
  [`preventUnsavedChanges`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#prevent-users-losing-unsaved-changes).
- Deprecated APIs:
  - `useStorageStatus` is now deprecated in favor of `useSyncStatus`.

### `@liveblocks/react-ui`

- Take composers into account when the new `preventUnsavedChanges` option is
  set.

### `@liveblocks/react-lexical`

- Add new hook
  [`useIsEditorReady`](http://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-lexical#useIsEditorReady)
  which can be used to show a skeleton UI before the editor has received the
  initial text from the server.
- Deprecated APIs:
  - `useEditorStatus` is now deprecated in favor of `useIsEditorReady` (or
    `useSyncStatus`).

## Examples

- Added new canvas document type to
  [Next.js Starter Kit](https://liveblocks.io/nextjs-starter-kit), powered by
  [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev/).
- Added loading `useStatusSync` loading spinners to
  [Linear-like Issue Tracker](https://liveblocks.io/examples/linear-like-issue-tracker/nextjs-linear-like-issue-tracker)
  and
  [Notion-like AI editor](https://liveblocks.io/examples/notion-like-ai-editor/nextjs-notion-like-ai-editor).
- Added `useIsEditorReady` to Lexical examples.

## Dashboard

- Redirect users to a specific error page on authentication failure.

# Week 24 (2024-06-14)

## v2.0.0

This major release marks the maturity of Liveblocks. It contains new products
(`@liveblocks/react-lexical`) and clarifications (e.g.
`@liveblocks/react-comments` is now called `@liveblocks/react-ui`). t Also, we
bring major DX improvements by allowing you to specify your types globally now.
These types will be typed once and shared across all Liveblocks APIs, which
includes your Node backend.

```ts file="liveblocks.config.ts"
// ❌ Before
export const {
  suspense: {
    RoomProvider,
    useRoom,
    // etc
  },
} = createRoomContext<Presence, Storage>(client);

// ✅ After
declare global {
  interface Liveblocks {
    Presence: Presence;
    Storage: Storage;
  }
}
```

In `@liveblocks/react`, you can now import hooks directly:

```ts file="MyComponent.tsx"
// ❌ Before: get hooks exported from your Liveblocks config
import { RoomProvider, useRoom, ... } from "./liveblocks.config";

// ✅ After: import hooks directly
import { RoomProvider, useRoom, ... } from "@liveblocks/react";
import { RoomProvider, useRoom, ... } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";
```

```ts
// ❌ Before
const client = createClient(/* options */);

// ✅ After
<LiveblocksProvider /* options */>
  <App />
</LiveblocksProvider>;
```

  `createThread`, `editThreadMetadata`, `createComment`, `editComment`,

transform comments, to `@liveblocks/node`.

## `@liveblocks/node`

- Add all the REST APIs as fully typed methods to `Liveblocks` client. See
  [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#Liveblocks-client).
- Add utilities to work with the `CommentBody` format from Comments:
  - `getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody(body)` - Get a list of all mentioned IDs
    from a `CommentBody`. See
    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-mentioned-ids-from-comment-body).
  - `stringifyCommentBody(body, options)` - Convert a `CommentBody` to a string,
    either as plain text, HTML, or Markdown. It supports resolving mention IDs
    similarly to `@liveblocks/react` and overriding each element to control the
    formatting. See
    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#stringify-comment-body).

# v1.7.1

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

- Fix `Composer` focus issues.
- Improve relative date formatting for some locales. (e.g. the `"fr"`` locale
  formatted “1h ago” as “-1 h” instead of “il y a 1 h”)
- Improve default monospace font for inline code blocks.

# v1.7.0

[Liveblocks Comments](https://liveblocks.io/comments) is now available for
everyone as a public beta, learn more about this
[in the announcement](https://liveblocks.io/blog/liveblocks-comments-is-available-for-everyone).

## `@liveblocks/client`

- Improve some internal logging.

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Improve Comments-specific error logging.

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

- Improve default relative date formatting. (e.g. “2 hours ago” → “2h ago”)

## `create-liveblocks-app`

- Add `ThreadMetadata` type to `--init` command.

# v1.6.0

## `@liveblocks/yjs`

- Add support for subdocs.

# v1.5.2

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Fix return type of `resolveUsers`.

# v1.5.1

- Fixes a bug in the bounds check of the `backgroundKeepAliveTimeout` option.

# v1.5.0

Support multiple RoomProviders, or mixing and matching our React package in the
same app with a Redux and/or Zustand instance.

At the client level, there is a new API for entering/leaving rooms, which we’re
now recommending over the old APIs. (The old APIs remain working exactly how
they are today, however.)

```ts
// Old APIs we'll no longer be recommending (but that will remain working)
const room = client.enter("my-room", options);
client.getRoom("my-room");
client.leave("my-room");
```

```ts
// New API we'll be recommending instead
const { room, leave } = client.enterRoom("my-room", options);
leave();
```

## `@liveblocks/client`

- New client config option: `backgroundKeepAliveTimeout` (a numeric value in
  milliseconds). See
  [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientBackgroundKeepAliveTimeout).
- New APIs:
  - `Client.enterRoom(roomId, options)` – enters the room and return both the
    room and an "unsubscribe function" to leave that room again. This newer API
    supports entering/leaving the same room multiple times, making it possible
    to connect to the same room from different parts of your application. See
    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.enterRoom).
  - `Client.logout()` – Call this on the Liveblocks client when you log out a
    user in your application. It will purge all auth tokens and force-leave any
    rooms, if any are still connected. See
    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.logout).
  - `LiveList.clone()` – see
    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveList.clone).
  - `LiveMap.clone()` – see
    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveMap.clone).
  - `LiveObject.clone()` – see
    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveObject.clone).
- Deprecated APIs:
  - `client.enter(roomId, options)`
  - `client.leave(roomId)`
- Renamed enter option: `shouldInitiallyConnect` → `autoConnect`. Its meaning or
  working did not change.
- Fixes a potential `Cannot set parent: node already has a parent` error when
  initializing storage with Live datastructures that are already tied to a
  Storage tree.

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Support using multiple `RoomProvider` components in your component tree for
  the same room ID.
- Renamed `RoomProvider` prop: `shouldInitiallyConnect` → `autoConnect`. Its
  meaning or working did not change.
- New hook:
  - `useOthersListener({ type, user, others })`, see
    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersListener)

## `@liveblocks/redux`

- **Breaking:** The `leaveRoom()` function no longer accepts a `roomId`. It will
  always leave the currently joined room.

## `@liveblocks/zustand`

- The `enterRoom()` function will now return a leave callback function.
- **Breaking:** The `leaveRoom()` function no longer accepts a `roomId`. It will
  always leave the currently joined room.

# v1.4.8

## `create-liveblocks-app`

- Add Comments hooks and options to `--init` command.

## `@liveblocks/client`

- Export all `CommentBody`-related types.

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

- Improve default styles:
  - Cap CSS selector specificity to improve overridability.
  - Set tokens on `.lb-root` instead of `:root` to improve cascading tokens
    (overriding `--lb-accent` on `body` for example, didn't create the expected
    results), and to work within shadow DOMs.
- Fix reactions and links styles on Safari.

# v1.4.7

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Fix `userIds` type in `ResolveUsersArgs`.

# v1.4.6

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Fix a race condition that could cause a Liveblocks client to hang during
  loading when using Suspense.
- Fix `useStatus` return value on SSR responses.
- **Breaking (beta):** The `resolveUser` option in `createRoomContext` is now
  called `resolveUsers` and it receives a list of user IDs (via the `userIds`
  property, replacing `userId`) instead of a single one. Instead of returning
  user info of a single user ID, this function will now expect a list of users'
  info matching the provided list of user IDs.
- **Breaking (beta):** The `ResolveUserOptions` and
  `ResolveMentionSuggestionsOptions` types were renamed to `ResolveUsersArgs`
  and `ResolveMentionSuggestionsArgs` respectively.
- `resolveUsers` and `resolveMentionSuggestions` now accept synchronous
  functions.
- `resolveUsers` now also provides the current room ID.
- `editThreadMetadata` now correctly allows `null` to be set on a property.
  Doing so deletes existing metadata properties.

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

- Export `ComposerSubmitComment` type from root too, in addition to
  `/primitives`.
- Add `onThreadDelete` to `Thread`.
- Add `metadata` to `Composer` to attach custom metadata to new threads.
- Add support for specifying a custom `ThreadMetadata` type on `Thread` and
  `Composer`.
- **Breaking (beta):** `Comment`’s `onEdit` and `onDelete` were renamed to
  `onEditComment` and `onDeleteComment` respectively.

- Fix `createThread` not creating valid comment.

## `@liveblocks/node`

- Fix URL encoding bug

# v1.4.4

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Fix a bug in `useOthers()` that could lead to the warning "The result of
  getServerSnapshot should be cached to avoid an infinite loop"

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

- Add support for reactions. (👍)
- Add keyboard navigation to emoji picker.

# v1.4.2

## `@liveblocks/client`

- Fix a bug where calculating the insertion position between two existing
  elements could happen incorrectly in a small edge case

# v1.4.1

## `@liveblocks/*`

- [#1177](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/1177) Fix an issue with
  internal LiveList serialization that could lead to a "ghosting" bug with
  `@liveblocks/zustand` / `@liveblocks/redux` when using tuples.

## `@liveblocks/node`

- Add comment reaction webhook events `CommentReactionAdded` and
  `CommentReactionRemoved`

# v1.4.0

## DevTools

- New Yjs tab: visualize Yjs documents as a diagram, a tree, or as a list of
  operations, and inspect Awareness at the same time as Presence.
- New Events tab: inspect all custom Events a client receives in an event
  timeline, for easy testing/debugging.

## `@liveblocks/yjs`

- Add support for the Liveblocks [DevTools](https://liveblocks.io/devtools).

## `@liveblocks/client`

- Broadcast event messages now include a `user` property to indicate the user
  that sent the event:
  ```tsx
  room.subscribe("event", ({ event, user }) => {
    //                              ^^^^ New!
  });
  ```

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Broadcast event messages now include a `user` property to indicate the user
  that sent the event:
  ```tsx
  useEventListener(({ event, user }) => {
    //                       ^^^^ New!
  });
  ```
- **Breaking (beta):** Comments' hook `useThreads` now returns an object in its
  Suspense version. (`const threads = useThreads()` becomes
  `const { threads } = useThreads()`)

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

- **Breaking (beta):** `Comment`’s `indentBody` and `Thread`’s
  `indentCommentBody` were renamed to `indentContent` and `indentCommentContent`
  respectively. `Thread`’s `onResolveChange` was renamed to `onResolvedChange`.
- Add emoji button in `Composer`.

## `@liveblocks/node`

- Support using `@liveblocks/node` in
  [Edge runtimes](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime).

# v1.3.6

## `@liveblocks/client`

- Support `unstable_fallbackToHTTP` client option when using any auth token type
  (previously it only worked when using single-room tokens, which we no longer
  recommend since 1.2)

# v1.3.5

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Officially mark `useList()`, `useMap()`, and `useObject()` as deprecated in
  JSDoc comments (we stopped recommending them since the release of 0.18)
- Deduplicate Comments requests and improve how race conditions are handled
  during mutations.
- Fix non-Suspense Comments hooks not working properly in some situations.

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

- **Breaking (beta):** Replace the render prop API (e.g. `renderMention`,
  `renderLink`, etc) by a single `components` prop. (e.g.
  `components={{ Mention, Link }}`)
- Fix overflowing `Composer.Suggestions`.
- Reduce the impact of icons on bundle size.

# v1.3.4

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Fix confusing `Error: "undefined" is not a valid event name` error when using
  the (deprecated) `useMap()`, `useObject()`, or `useList()` hooks on
  uninitialized storage values.

# v1.3.3

## `@liveblocks/*`

- Fix unescaped room IDs when using Comments.

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

- Add support for auto links. (e.g. `"www.liveblocks.io"`)

# v1.3.2

## `@liveblocks/client`

- The client will disconnect with an error if your `/api/liveblocks-auth`
  backend returns reused/cached tokens. It’s important that auth tokens are
  always freshly generated, and never get cached or reused. (The client itself
  will cache and reuse tokens already, so implementing additional caching in
  your backend isn’t needed, and could even cause reconnection issues.)

# v1.3.1

## `@liveblocks/client`

- Actually include the new Clear History API.

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Fix missing dependency declaration.

# v1.3.0

This release marks the initial release of
[Liveblocks Comments](https://liveblocks.io/comments) (private beta).

## `@liveblocks/client`

- New history API: `room.history.clear()` allows you to explicitly clear the
  history, which resets the ability to undo beyond the current state.
- Removed long deprecated methods:
  - `others.count` → Use `others.length` instead
  - `others.toArray()` → Use `others` instead (it’s already an array)
- Deprecated the `Others<P, U>` type → Use `readonly User<P, U>[]` instead.

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Add support for Comments.
- `UserMeta["info"]` can no longer be a scalar value.

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

- Initial release.

## `@liveblocks/node`

- Add Comments helpers to Client.
- Add Comments webhook events.

# v1.2.4

## `@liveblocks/node`

- Fixes a bug where sending an empty (or non-string) user ID with
  `.identifyUser` would confusingly get reported as an HTTP 503.

# v1.2.3

## `@liveblocks/client`

- Improve configuration error messages to be more user friendly.
- Fix bug where entering a new room could potentially initialize the undo stack
  incorrectly.

## `create-liveblocks-app`

- Fix Suspense option when specifying a framework.
- Add helpful comments by default.

# v1.2.2

## `@liveblocks/node`

- Add Yjs document change event (`YDocUpdatedEvent`) to `WebhookHandler`.
- Allow `Header` object to be passed to `headers` in
  `WebhookHandler.verifyRequest()`

# v1.2.1

## `@liveblocks/node`

- Fix session.allow to support path up to 128 characters to meet room id length
  requirement.

# v1.2.0

## `@liveblocks/*`

- Support the new and improved Liveblocks authorization.
- Change client logic to stop retrying if room is full. Instead, the client will
  now disconnect. To retry, call `room.reconnect()` explicitly.

## `@liveblocks/node`

- Add new APIs for authorization. See our migration guide for tips on how to
  adopt the new style of authorizing your Liveblocks clients.

# v1.1.8

- Fix a small TypeScript issue introduced in 1.1.7.

# v1.1.7

## `@liveblocks/client`

- When initializing the client with a
  [custom auth callback](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientCallback),
  you can now return `{ error: "forbidden", reason: ... }` as the response,
  which the client will treat as a sign to stop retrying. The client will then
  disconnect from the room, instead of remaining in `"connecting"` status
  indefinitely.

## `@liveblocks/react`

- Fix a bug with `useSelf()` where it would not correctly re-render after
  entering an empty room. It’s now consistent again with `useMyPresence()`.

## DevTools

- Fix a bug in the Liveblocks [DevTools](https://liveblocks.io/devtools) panel
  where the "me" view would incorrectly stay empty after entering an empty room.

# v1.1.6

## `@liveblocks/*`

- Loosen duplicate import detection so it won't throw when used in test runners
  that deliberately run multiple instances of a module (like Jest or Playwright
  can do).

# v1.1.5

## `@liveblocks/*`

- Ship all of our packages as both ESM and CJS modules again (restore the
  changes that 1.1.3 originally introduced).
- Auto-detect if multiple copies of Liveblocks are included in your production
  bundle. If so, a help page is presented that will help you resolve this issue.
- Fix a bug where the room internals could become non-functional when used in
  combination with Immer due to Immer’s excessive auto-freezing, which would
  break the room’s internals. (This became an issue since Liveblocks 1.1 was
  released.)

# v1.1.4

- Undo the changes made in 1.1.3. We’ve got some bug reports where Liveblocks
  could still be doubly-included in production bundles (in some bundler setups
  only), with storage data corruptions as a possible result. We’re
  investigating.

# v1.1.3

Ship all of our packages as both ESM and CJS modules. By upgrading, your
project’s bundler can now perform (better) tree-shaking on the Liveblocks code.

You can expect (at least) the following bundle size reductions:

- `@liveblocks/client` from 80kB → 70kB
- `@liveblocks/react` from 129kB → 80kB
- `@liveblocks/redux` from 84kB → 38kB
- `@liveblocks/zustand` from 83kB → 37kB
- `@liveblocks/yjs` from 129kB → 74kB

# v1.1.2

## `@liveblocks/yjs`

Added Yjs support to **open beta** through the new `@liveblocks/yjs` package
(not stable yet).

### Fixes

- Fixes a missing internal export.

# v1.1.1

- Fixes a bug where under certain circumstances the Liveblocks client could
  incorrectly throw a `Not started yet` error message.

# v1.1.0

This release improves the client’s internals to ensure a more reliable
connection with Liveblocks servers.

## `@liveblocks/client`

- New APIs:
  - `room.getStatus()`: returns the current status of the WebSocket connection:
    `"initial"`, `"connecting"`, `"connected"`, `"reconnecting"`, or
    `"disconnected"`
  - `room.subscribe("status")`: subscribe to changes of the connection status.
  - `room.subscribe("lost-connection")`: high-level API to get informed when
    Liveblocks’ automatic reconnection process is taking longer than usual, so
    you can show a toast message on screen. (See this
    [example](https://liveblocks.io/examples/connection-status) for an
    illustration.)
- New behavior:
  - The client will stop retrying to establish a connection in cases where
    retrying would not help. For example an explicit 403 forbidden response from
    your backend, or a configuration error.
  - The client will more quickly reconnect even after long periods of sleep.

## `@liveblocks/react`

- New APIs:
  - `useStatus()` - React hook version of `room.getStatus()`
  - `useLostConnectionListener()` - React hook version of
    `room.subscribe("lost-connection")` (See this
    [example](https://liveblocks.io/examples/connection-status) for an
    illustration.)

### Bugs fixed

- Reconnection would sometimes not work after long periods of sleep. Waking up
  is now instant.
- React clients using Suspense could sometimes incorrectly bounce back to the
  Suspense boundary after a successful load. No longer!
- Client could sometimes not load storage after reconnecting. Not anymore!
- Others array will no longer flash during an internal reconnect.
- DevTools now keeps working even when the client goes offline.

### Deprecated APIs

These APIs still work, but are replaced by newer APIs. The old APIs will be
removed in a future release of Liveblocks.

Old connection status codes are replaced by the new ones:

| ❌ Old statuses | ✅ New statuses |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| closed          | initial         |
| authenticating  | connecting      |
| connecting      | connecting      |
| open            | connected       |
| unavailable     | reconnecting    |
| failed          | disconnected    |

Recommended steps to upgrade:

- ❌ `room.getConnectionState()` → ✅ `room.getStatus()`
- ❌ `room.subscribe('connection')` → ✅ `room.subscribe('status')`
- Old client options:
  - ❌ `clientOptions.fetchPolyfill`
  - ❌ `clientOptions.WebSocketPolyfill` → ✅
    `clientOptions.polyfills: { fetch, WebSocket }`

Get the storage status.

- `not-loaded`: Initial state when entering the room.
- `loading`: Once the storage has been requested via room.getStorage().
- `synchronizing`: When some local updates have not been acknowledged by
  Liveblocks servers.
- `synchronized`: Storage is in sync with Liveblocks servers.

## Room.subscribe("storage-status", status => { })

Subscribe to storage status changes.

Returns an unsubscribe function.

```typescript
room.subscribe("storage-status", (status) => {
  switch (status) {
    case "not-loaded":
      break;
    case "loading":
      break;
    case "synchronizing":

  }
});
```

# v0.19.2

Fixes some internal type definitions.

# v0.19.1

Fixes an issue where `import`s from Liveblocks packages could not be resolved
correctly in certain build environments.

# v0.19.0

This release brings Zustand v4 support. This is a breaking change **only if
you’re using @liveblocks/zustand**.

In **@liveblocks/zustand**:

- Support Zustand v4 (actually v4.1.3 or higher)
- Drop support for Zustand v3 (also v4.1.2 or lower are not supported)
- Fix bug where some usage pattern could cause the Zustand store to stop
  synching (#491)

To migrate, make the following code changes:

- `npm install zustand@latest`
- `npm install @liveblocks/zustand@latest`
- Change these imports, if applicable:
  ```diff
  -import { middleware } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
  +import { liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
  ```
  and
  ```diff
  -import type { LiveblocksState } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
  +import type { WithLiveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
  ```
  and rename accordingly.
- Change the pattern:
  ```ts
  create(liveblocks<MyState, ...>(...))
  ```
  to the Zustand v4 recommended pattern:
  ```ts
  create<WithLiveblocks<MyState, ...>>()(liveblocks(...))
  ```
  To be clear:
  1.  First, move the type annotation away from the `liveblocks` middleware
      call, and onto the `create` call.
  2.  Next, wrap your `MyState` type in a `WithLiveblocks<...>` wrapper. This
      will make sure the injected `liveblocks` property on your Zustand state
      will be correctly typed.
  3.  Finally, make sure to add the extra call `()` wrapper, needed by Zustand
      v4 now:
      ```ts
      create<WithLiveblocks<MyState, ...>>()(liveblocks(...))
      //                                  ^^ Not a typo
      ```
- Remove the second argument to `state.liveblocks.enterRoom()`: it no longer
  takes an explicit initial state. Instead, it's automatically be populated from
  your Zustand state.

In **@liveblocks/redux**:

- The main export has been renamed:
  ```diff
  -import { enhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";
  +import { liveblocksEnhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";
  ```
- The second argument to `state.liveblocks.enterRoom()` to send in an explicit
  initial state is no longer supported. It will use the state in your Redux
  store, for consistency and ease of use.

# v0.18.5

Bug fix:

- Fixes a small bug in a type definition, `scopes` was removed from
  `BaseUserMeta`.

Internal updates:

- Switch the monorepo over to Turborepo.

# v0.18.4

All packages now provide an `isReadOnly` flag on user instances. It is available
when getting self or others. `isReadOnly` is true when storage is read-only, see
the
[room management guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/managing-rooms-users-permissions#permissions)
for more information.

```ts
const me = room.getSelf();

me.isReadOnly; // boolean

const others = room.getOthers();
for (const other of others) {
  other.isReadOnly; // boolean
}
```

In **@liveblocks/client**:

- Add a new option `shouldInitiallyConnect` to `client.enter` that let you
  control whether or not the room connects to Liveblocks servers. Default is
  `true`.

  Usually set to false when the client is used from the server to not call the
  authentication endpoint or connect via WebSocket.

In **@liveblocks/react**:

- Add a new property `shouldInitiallyConnect` to `RoomProvider` that let you
  control whether or not the room connects to Liveblocks servers. Default is
  `true`.

  By default equals to `typeof window !== "undefined"`, meaning the RoomProvider
  tries to connect to Liveblocks servers only on the client side.

- Internal package restructurings to increase code sharing. You may notice a new
  dependency show up in your dependency tree: `@liveblocks/core`. It contains
  private APIs that aren't intended for direct consumption.

# v0.18.3

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  Fixes the "zombie-child" problem that can occur with React 17 or lower. **If
  you’re on React 18: great, you can ignore this!** If you’re using React 17 or
  lower with Liveblocks, we’ll now start to enforce that you pass the
  `unstable_batchedUpdates` prop to RoomProvider, so this problem can be
  circumvented. This small addition may save you hours of debugging time!

  ```tsx
  // ⚠️  Only if you’re using React 17 or lower
  import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from "react-dom";  // 👈

  <RoomProvider
    id="my-room"
    initialPresence={...}
    initialStorage={...}
    unstable_batchedUpdates={unstable_batchedUpdates}  // 👈
  >
    <App />
  </RoomProvider>
  ```

  https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/troubleshooting#stale-props-zombie-child

- In **@liveblocks/zustand**:

  - Fix a confusing error message

# v0.18.2

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Make sure that `useOther` will not rerender if tracked users already left
    the room, so that child components won't get rerendered before the parent
    got the chance to unmount them.
  - Disallow `useOther` without selector

# v0.18.1

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Fix a bug that could cause an error when patching presence during local
    development. Not an issue in production builds. (#505)

# v0.18.0

For information, please read our
[Upgrade Guide for 0.18](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.18).

## New React hooks ✨

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - [`useStorage`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useStorage)
  - [`useMutation`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMutation)
  - [`useSelf`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useSelf)
  - [`useOthers`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthers)
  - [`useOthersMapped`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersMapped)
  - [`useOthersConnectionIds`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersConnectionIds)
  - [`useOther`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOther)
    (singular)

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - New
    [`.toImmutable()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveObject.toImmutable)
    method on `LiveObject`, `LiveList`, and `LiveMap` lets you work with an
    immutable representation of the storage objects
  - Improved core performance
  - Reduced bundle size
  - Others only become visible in the `others` array if their presence is known

## Breaking changes

- Remove support for directly importing hooks from **@liveblocks/client** (e.g.
  `import { useMyPresence } from '@liveblocks/react'`). If you’re still using
  these imports, see the
  [Upgrade Guide for 0.17](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17)
  for instructions.
- Remove `ClientProvider` and `useClient` hook
- Remove `defaultPresence` and `defaultStorageRoot` arguments. (Just use
  `initialPresence` and `initialStorage` arguments now.)
- Remove second argument to `useMap()`, `useList()`, and `useObject()`.
- Remove `new LiveMap(null)` support. (Just use `new LiveMap()` or
  `new LiveMap([])`.)

# v0.17.11

General:

- Fix a packaging bug

In **@liveblocks/react**:

- Deprecate an undocumented API

# v0.17.9

- Fix bug that could cause duplicate copies of @liveblocks/client to end up in
  final bundle, for certain bundler configurations.
- Fix bug where in some conditions the initial presence for a new connection
  would not come through to all existing clients in the room
- Various internal changes

# v0.17.8

## New history APIs ↩️ ↪️

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - Add `canUndo()` and `canRedo()` utilities to `room.history`
  - Add `"history"` event type to `room.subscribe()` to subscribe to the current
    user's history changes

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Add `useCanUndo()` and `useCanRedo()` hooks

# v0.17.7

- In **@liveblocks/zustand**:

  - Simplify zustand middleware integration with Typescript. `TPresence`,
    `TStorage`, `TUserMeta`, and `TRoomEvent` are now optional.

Note that `@liveblocks/zustand` does not work with zustand > v4 because v3 and
v4 have completely different type definitions. As soon as zustand v4 is out of
the RC phase, we will consider updating our middleware to work with the latest
version.

### Example

Let's take a look at our
[To-do list](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/examples/zustand-todo-list)
example. Without our middleware, the store would look like this:

```ts
import create from "zustand";

type State = {
  draft: string;
  isTyping: boolean;
  todos: Todo[];
  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;
  addTodo: () => void;
  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;
};

create<State>(/* ... */);
```

With our middleware, you simply need to move the `State` param at the middleware
level:

```ts
import create from "zustand";
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { middleware } from "@liveblocks/zustand";

const client = createClient({ /*...*/ });

type State = {
  draft: string;
  isTyping: boolean;
  todos: Todo[];
  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;
  addTodo: () => void;
  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;
};

create(
  middleware<State>(/* ... */, {
    client,
    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },
    storageMapping: { todos: true }
  })
);
```

If you want to type `others` presence, you can use the `TPresence` generic
argument on the middleware.

```ts

type Presence = {
  isTyping: true;
}

const useStore = create(
  middleware<State, Presence>(/* ... */, {
    client,
    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },
    storageMapping: { todos: true }
  })
);

// In your component
useStore(state => state.liveblocks.others[0].presence?.isTyping)
```

# v0.17.6

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Expose `RoomContext` in the return value of `createRoomContext()`

# v0.17.5

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Fix bug where changing the `key` argument of `useMap()`, `useList()`,
    `useObject()` did not resubscribe to updates correctly
  - Ignore changes to the `RoomProvider`'s initial presence/storage props on
    subsequent renders. This makes it behave closer to `useState(initialState)`

# v0.17.4

Fix missing documentation for hooks created via `createRoomContext()`.

# v0.17.1

Fix `@liveblocks/nodes` packaging.

# v0.17.0

For information, please read our
[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17).

## TypeScript improvements ✨

This release contains major TypeScript improvements. The recommended setup now
is that you define your own Presence and Storage types at the highest level
(i.e. where you set up the room). After that initial one-time setup, you will no
longer need to provide any extra type annotations anywhere for your Liveblocks
code! 🙌

To learn how to set that up, follow the instructions in our
[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17).

- No more `any` types used (in `@liveblocks/client` and `@liveblocks/react`)
- All APIs that work with Presence data will now require it to be
  JSON-serializable
- All APIs that work with Storage data will now require it to be LSON (= JSON +
  Live structures)
- All Live structures now take mandatory type params for their payloads, just
  like the built-in array, object, and map types do:
  - `LiveMap<K, V>` (like `Map<K, V>`)
  - `LiveObject<{ a: number, b: string }>` (like, for example,
    `{ a: number, b: string }`)
  - `LiveList<T>` (like `Array<T>`)

## React Native support ✨

We now support React Native! To learn how to use Liveblocks in your React Native
projects, see our
[API reference](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientReactNative).
It's surprisingly simple!

## New APIs ✨

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - [`createRoomContext()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#createRoomContext)
    is now the preferred way to initialize hooks.

- In the API:

  - New endpoint to
    [Get Users in a Room](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRoomUsers)
  - New endpoint to
    [Get a list of all Rooms](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRooms)

## Bug fixes 🐛

- Improved conflict resolution on LiveList
- Various minor internal bug fixes

## Breaking changes

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - Removed old `Room.unsubscribe()` API

## New deprecations

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - The `defaultPresence` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to
    `initialPresence`
  - The `defaultStorageRoot` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to
    `initialStorage`
  - Calling `new LiveMap(null)` will stop working. Please use `new LiveMap()`,
    or `new LiveMap([])`

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Importing the React hooks directly is deprecated, instead use the new
    `createRoomContext()` helper. For help, read the
    [Recommended Upgrade Steps section](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17#recommended-upgrade-steps)
    within our
    [Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17)
  - The second argument to `useList()`, `useObject()`, and `useMap()` is
    deprecated
  - The RoomProvider's `defaultPresence` is renamed to `initialPresence`
  - The RoomProvider's `defaultStorageRoot` is renamed to `initialStorage`

### `LiveList.set`

Set one element at a specified index.

```typescript

list.set(0, "🐺");
list.toArray(); // equals ["🐺", "🦊", "🐵"]
```

https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/147 for more information

⚠️ **_Before using `LiveList.set`, you need to make sure that all connected
clients are using `0.16.0`. If a client is connected to a room with version
`< 0.16`, `LiveList.set` might lead to slightly unexpected behavior._**

## TypeScript improvements

@nvie improved our typescript definitions! They are more precise and restrictive
(for your own good :)). If typescript errors appears after upgrading to `0.16.0`
and they are not clear, please create a Github issue and we'll help you.
