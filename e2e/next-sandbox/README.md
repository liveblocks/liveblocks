# User Notification Settings Configuration

To make the user notification settings e2e tests running locally you need to
ensure you have setup your project notification settings first. It can be done
by doing either:

- üëâüèª Go to the project notification page on the dashboard locally (e.g
  `http://localhost:3001/dashboard/<account_id>/projects/<project_id>/notifications`)
  ‚Üí It will automatically do the job just by visiting this page.
- üëâüèª Run the following CURL request:
  ```sh
  curl -X POST \
    'https://<dev_worker_url>/dashboard/projects/<project_id>/notification-settings/setup' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: <authorization_token>' \
    -d '{}'
  ```
  ‚Üí It will setup your project notification settings.
  > Those user notification settings e2e tests are skipped on CI for now.
