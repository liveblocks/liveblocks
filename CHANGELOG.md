# v0.19.1

Fixes an issue where `import`s from Liveblocks packages could not be resolved
correctly in certain build environments.

# v0.19.0

This release brings Zustand v4 support. This is a breaking change **only if
you‚Äôre using @liveblocks/zustand**.

In **@liveblocks/zustand**:

- Support Zustand v4 (actually v4.1.3 or higher)
- Drop support for Zustand v3 (also v4.1.2 or lower are not supported)
- Fix bug where some usage pattern could cause the Zustand store to stop
  synching (#491)

To migrate, make the following code changes:

- `npm install zustand@latest`
- `npm install @liveblocks/zustand@latest`
- Change these imports, if applicable:
  ```diff
  -import { middleware } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
  +import { liveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
  ```
  and
  ```diff
  -import type { LiveblocksState } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
  +import type { WithLiveblocks } from "@liveblocks/zustand";
  ```
  and rename accordingly.
- Change the pattern:
  ```ts
  create(liveblocks<MyState, ...>(...))
  ```
  to the Zustand v4 recommended pattern:
  ```ts
  create<WithLiveblocks<MyState, ...>>()(liveblocks(...))
  ```
  To be clear:
  1. First, move the type annotation away from the `liveblocks` middleware call,
     and onto the `create` call.
  2. Next, wrap your `MyState` type in a `WithLiveblocks<...>` wrapper. This
     will make sure the injected `liveblocks` property on your Zustand state
     will be correctly typed.
  3. Finally, make sure to add the extra call `()` wrapper, needed by Zustand v4
     now:
     ```ts
     create<WithLiveblocks<MyState, ...>>()(liveblocks(...))
     //                                  ^^ Not a typo
     ```
- Remove the second argument to `state.liveblocks.enterRoom()`: it no longer
  takes an explicit initial state. Instead, it's automatically be populated from
  your Zustand state.

In **@liveblocks/redux**:

- The main export has been renamed:
  ```diff
  -import { enhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";
  +import { liveblocksEnhancer } from "@liveblocks/redux";
  ```
- The second argument to `state.liveblocks.enterRoom()` to send in an explicit
  initial state is no longer supported. It will use the state in your Redux
  store, for consistency and ease of use.

# v0.18.5

Bug fix:

- Fixes a small bug in a type definition, `scopes` was removed from
  `BaseUserMeta`.

Internal updates:

- Switch the monorepo over to Turborepo.

# v0.18.4

All packages now provide an `isReadOnly` flag on user instances. It is available
when getting self or others. `isReadOnly` is true when storage is read-only, see
the
[room management guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/managing-rooms-users-permissions#permissions)
for more information.

```ts
const me = room.getSelf();

me.isReadOnly; // boolean

const others = room.getOthers();
for (const other of others) {
  other.isReadOnly; // boolean
}
```

In **@liveblocks/client**:

- Add a new option `shouldInitiallyConnect` to `client.enter` that let you
  control whether or not the room connects to Liveblocks servers. Default is
  `true`.

  Usually set to false when the client is used from the server to not call the
  authentication endpoint or connect via WebSocket.

In **@liveblocks/react**:

- Add a new property `shouldInitiallyConnect` to `RoomProvider` that let you
  control whether or not the room connects to Liveblocks servers. Default is
  `true`.

  By default equals to `typeof window !== "undefined"`, meaning the RoomProvider
  tries to connect to Liveblocks servers only on the client side.

- Internal package restructurings to increase code sharing. You may notice a new
  dependency show up in your dependency tree: `@liveblocks/core`. It contains
  private APIs that aren't intended for direct consumption.

# v0.18.3

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  Fixes the "zombie-child" problem that can occur with React 17 or lower. **If
  you‚Äôre on React 18: great, you can ignore this!** If you‚Äôre using React 17 or
  lower with Liveblocks, we‚Äôll now start to enforce that you pass the
  `unstable_batchedUpdates` prop to RoomProvider, so this problem can be
  circumvented. This small addition may save you hours of debugging time!

  ```tsx
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è  Only if you‚Äôre using React 17 or lower
  import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from "react-dom";  // üëà

  <RoomProvider
    id="my-room"
    initialPresence={...}
    initialStorage={...}
    unstable_batchedUpdates={unstable_batchedUpdates}  // üëà
  >
    <App />
  </RoomProvider>
  ```

  To read more, see
  https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/troubleshooting#stale-props-zombie-child

- In **@liveblocks/zustand**:

  - Fix a confusing error message

# v0.18.2

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Make sure that `useOther` will not rerender if tracked users already left
    the room, so that child components won't get rerendered before the parent
    got the chance to unmount them.
  - Disallow `useOther` without selector

# v0.18.1

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Fix a bug that could cause an error when patching presence during local
    development. Not an issue in production builds. (#505)

# v0.18.0

For information, please read our
[Upgrade Guide for 0.18](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.18).

### New React hooks ‚ú®

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - [`useStorage`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useStorage)
  - [`useMutation`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMutation)
  - [`useSelf`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useSelf)
  - [`useOthers`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthers)
  - [`useOthersMapped`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersMapped)
  - [`useOthersConnectionIds`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersConnectionIds)
  - [`useOther`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOther)
    (singular)

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - New
    [`.toImmutable()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveObject.toImmutable)
    method on `LiveObject`, `LiveList`, and `LiveMap` lets you work with an
    immutable representation of the storage objects
  - Improved core performance
  - Reduced bundle size
  - Others only become visible in the `others` array if their presence is known

### Breaking changes

- Remove support for directly importing hooks from **@liveblocks/client** (e.g.
  `import { useMyPresence } from '@liveblocks/react'`). If you‚Äôre still using
  these imports, see the
  [Upgrade Guide for 0.17](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17) for
  instructions.
- Remove `ClientProvider` and `useClient` hook
- Remove `defaultPresence` and `defaultStorageRoot` arguments. (Just use
  `initialPresence` and `initialStorage` arguments now.)
- Remove second argument to `useMap()`, `useList()`, and `useObject()`.
- Remove `new LiveMap(null)` support. (Just use `new LiveMap()` or
  `new LiveMap([])`.)

# v0.17.11

General:

- Fix a packaging bug

In **@liveblocks/react**:

- Deprecate an undocumented API

---

# v0.17.9

- Fix bug that could cause duplicate copies of @liveblocks/client to end up in
  final bundle, for certain bundler configurations.

---

# v0.17.8

### New history APIs ‚Ü©Ô∏è ‚Ü™Ô∏è

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - Add `canUndo()` and `canRedo()` utilities to `room.history`
  - Add `"history"` event type to `room.subscribe()` to subscribe to the current
    user's history changes

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Add `useCanUndo()` and `useCanRedo()` hooks

---

# v0.17.7

- In **@liveblocks/zustand**:

  - Simplify zustand middleware integration with Typescript. `TPresence`,
    `TStorage`, `TUserMeta`, and `TRoomEvent` are now optional.

Note that `@liveblocks/zustand` does not work with zustand > v4 because v3 and
v4 have completely different type definitions. As soon as zustand v4 is out of
the RC phase, we will consider updating our middleware to work with the latest
version.

### Example

Let's take a look at our
[To-do list](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/examples/zustand-todo-list)
example. Without our middleware, the store would look like this:

```ts
import create from "zustand";

type State = {
  draft: string;
  isTyping: boolean;
  todos: Todo[];
  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;
  addTodo: () => void;
  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;
};

create<State>(/* ... */);
```

With our middleware, you simply need to move the `State` param at the middleware
level:

```ts
import create from "zustand";
import { createClient } from "@liveblocks/client";
import { middleware } from "@liveblocks/zustand";

const client = createClient({ /*...*/ });

type State = {
  draft: string;
  isTyping: boolean;
  todos: Todo[];
  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;
  addTodo: () => void;
  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;
};

create(
  middleware<State>(/* ... */, {
    client,
    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },
    storageMapping: { todos: true }
  })
);
```

If you want to type `others` presence, you can use the `TPresence` generic
argument on the middleware.

```ts

type Presence = {
  isTyping: true;
}

const useStore = create(
  middleware<State, Presence>(/* ... */, {
    client,
    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },
    storageMapping: { todos: true }
  })
);

// In your component
useStore(state => state.liveblocks.others[0].presence?.isTyping)
```

---

# v0.17.6

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Expose `RoomContext` in the return value of `createRoomContext()`

---

# v0.17.5

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Fix bug where changing the `key` argument of `useMap()`, `useList()`,
    `useObject()` did not resubscribe to updates correctly
  - Ignore changes to the `RoomProvider`'s initial presence/storage props on
    subsequent renders. This makes it behave closer to `useState(initialState)`

---

# v0.17.4

Fix missing documentation for hooks created via `createRoomContext()`.

---

# v0.17.1

Fix `@liveblocks/nodes` packaging.

---

# v0.17.0

For information, please read our
[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17).

### TypeScript improvements ‚ú®

This release contains major TypeScript improvements. The recommended setup now
is that you define your own Presence and Storage types at the highest level
(i.e. where you set up the room). After that initial one-time setup, you will no
longer need to provide any extra type annotations anywhere for your Liveblocks
code! üôå

To learn how to set that up, follow the instructions in our
[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17).

- No more `any` types used (in `@liveblocks/client` and `@liveblocks/react`)
- All APIs that work with Presence data will now require it to be
  JSON-serializable
- All APIs that work with Storage data will now require it to be LSON (= JSON +
  Live structures)
- All Live structures now take mandatory type params for their payloads, just
  like the built-in array, object, and map types do:
  - `LiveMap<K, V>` (like `Map<K, V>`)
  - `LiveObject<{ a: number, b: string }>` (like, for example,
    `{ a: number, b: string }`)
  - `LiveList<T>` (like `Array<T>`)

### React Native support ‚ú®

We now support React Native! To learn how to use Liveblocks in your React Native
projects, see our
[API reference](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientReactNative).
It's surprisingly simple!

### New APIs ‚ú®

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - [`createRoomContext()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#createRoomContext)
    is now the preferred way to initialize hooks.

- In the API:

  - New endpoint to
    [Get Users in a Room](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRoomUsers)
  - New endpoint to
    [Get a list of all Rooms](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRooms)

### Bug fixes üêõ

- Improved conflict resolution on LiveList
- Various minor internal bug fixes

### Breaking changes

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - Removed old `Room.unsubscribe()` API

### New deprecations

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - The `defaultPresence` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to
    `initialPresence`
  - The `defaultStorageRoot` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to
    `initialStorage`
  - Calling `new LiveMap(null)` will stop working. Please use `new LiveMap()`,
    or `new LiveMap([])`

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Importing the React hooks directly is deprecated, instead use the new
    `createRoomContext()` helper. For help, read the
    [Recommended Upgrade Steps section](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17#recommended-upgrade-steps)
    within our [Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17)
  - The second argument to `useList()`, `useObject()`, and `useMap()` is
    deprecated
  - The RoomProvider's `defaultPresence` is renamed to `initialPresence`
  - The RoomProvider's `defaultStorageRoot` is renamed to `initialStorage`

list.toArray(); // equals ["üê∫", "ü¶ä", "üêµ"]
```

https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/147 for more information

‚ö†Ô∏è **_Before using `LiveList.set`, you need to make sure that all connected
clients are using `0.16.0`. If a client is connected to a room with version
`< 0.16`, `LiveList.set` might lead to slightly unexpected behavior._**

### TypeScript improvements

@nvie improved our typescript definitions! They are more precise and restrictive
(for your own good :)). If typescript errors appears after upgrading to `0.16.0`
and they are not clear, please create a Github issue and we'll help you.
