# v0.17.0 (not yet released)

For information, please read our
[Upgrade Guide](https://preview.liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17).

### TypeScript improvements ‚ú®

This release contains major TypeScript improvements. The recommended setup now
is that you define your own Presence and Storage types at the highest level
(i.e. where you set up the room). After that initial one-time setup, you will no
longer need to provide any extra type annotations anywhere for your Liveblocks
code! üôå

To learn how to set that up, follow the instructions in our
[Upgrade Guide](https://preview.liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17).

- No more `any` types used (in `@liveblocks/client` and `@liveblocks/react`)
- All APIs that work with Presence data will now require it to be
  JSON-serializable
- All APIs that work with Storage data will now require it to be LSON (= JSON +
  Live structures)
- All Live structures now take mandatory type params for their payloads, just
  like the built-in array, object, and map types do:
  - `LiveMap<K, V>` (like `Map<K, V>`)
  - `LiveObject<{ a: number, b: string }>` (like, for example,
    `{ a: number, b: string }`)
  - `LiveList<T>` (like `Array<T>`)

### React Native support ‚ú®

We now support React Native! To learn how to use Liveblocks in your React Native
projects, see our
[API reference](https://preview.liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientReactNative).
It's surprisingly simple!

### New APIs ‚ú®

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - [`createRoomContext()`](https://preview.liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#createRoomContext)
    is now the preferred way to initialize hooks.

- In the API:

  - New endpoint to
    [Get Users in a Room](https://preview.liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRoomUsers)
  - New endpoint to
    [Get a list of all Rooms](https://preview.liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRooms)

### Bug fixes üêõ

- Improved conflict resolution on LiveList
- Various minor internal bug fixes

### Breaking changes

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - Removed old `Room.unsubscribe()` API

### New deprecations

- In **@liveblocks/client**:

  - The `defaultPresence` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to
    `initialPresence`
  - The `defaultStorageRoot` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to
    `initialStorage`
  - Calling `new LiveMap(null)` will stop working. Please use `new LiveMap()`,
    or `new LiveMap([])`

- In **@liveblocks/react**:

  - Importing the React hooks directly is deprecated, instead use the new
    `createRoomContext()` helper. For help, read the
    [Recommended Upgrade Steps section](https://preview.liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17#recommended-upgrade-steps)
    within our
    [Upgrade Guide](https://preview.liveblocks.io/docs/guides/upgrading/0.17)
  - The second argument to `useList()`, `useObject()`, and `useMap()` is
    deprecated
  - The RoomProvider's `defaultPresence` is renamed to `initialPresence`
  - The RoomProvider's `defaultStorageRoot` is renamed to `initialStorage`

#### `LiveList.set`

Set one element at a specified index.

```typescript
const list = new LiveList(["ü¶Å", "ü¶ä", "üêµ"]);
list.set(0, "üê∫");
list.toArray(); // equals ["üê∫", "ü¶ä", "üêµ"]
```

https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/147 for more information

‚ö†Ô∏è **_Before using `LiveList.set`, you need to make sure that all connected
clients are using `0.16.0`. If a client is connected to a room with version
`< 0.16`, `LiveList.set` might lead to slightly unexpected behavior._**

### TypeScript improvements

@nvie improved our typescript definitions! They are more precise and restrictive
(for your own good :)). If typescript errors appears after upgrading to `0.16.0`
and they are not clear, please create a Github issue and we'll help you.
