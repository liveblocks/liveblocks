**[Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io) is a real-time collaboration
infrastructure for building performant collaborative experiences.** The
foundations of Liveblocks are built upon the following concepts:

- **Products** enabling a different facet of collaborative experiences.
  - [Presence](/docs/products/presence) to show who’s in a document
  - [Broadcast](/docs/products/broadcast) to broadcast events in real-time
  - [Storage](/docs/products/storage) for a shared real-time document state
  - Comments (Private beta) to enable annotations, threads, and mentions
- **Rooms** are the digital spaces in which people collaborate.
- **Integrations** that developers can use to integrate with the Liveblocks
  products within the rooms.
- A fully-hosted **platform** built around a WebSocket edge infrastructure that
  includes tools such as REST APIs, webhooks, schema validation, analytics, and
  more.
