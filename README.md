**[Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io) is a real-time collaboration
infrastructure for building performant collaborative experiences.**

## How Liveblocks works

The foundations of Liveblocks are built upon four core concepts: products,
rooms, integrations, and platform.

### Products

Liveblocks is a fully integrated solution built around core products, each
enabling a different facet of collaborative experiences:
[Presence](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/presence),
[Broadcast](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/broadcast),
[Document](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/document), and
[Comments](https://liveblocks.io/docs/products/comments) (public beta). You can
decide what products you want to use based on your requirements and
collaborative experiences you’re looking to build.

### Rooms

A room is the digital space in which people collaborate. You can require your
users to be [authenticated](https://liveblocks.io/docs/rooms/authentication) to
interact with rooms, and each room can have specific
[permissions](https://liveblocks.io/docs/rooms/permissions) and
[metadata](https://liveblocks.io/docs/rooms/metadata) associated with them.

### Integrations

Integrations for specific libraries and frameworks to add Liveblocks-powered
collaborative experiences to your product. Integrations are designed to serve
various collaboration use cases such as text editors, comments, creative tools,
forms, and more.

- [`@liveblocks/client`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client)
- [`@liveblocks/react`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react)
- [`@liveblocks/redux`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-redux)
- [`@liveblocks/zustand`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-zustand)
- [`@liveblocks/yjs`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-yjs)

### Platform

Liveblocks provides a fully-hosted platform built around a WebSocket edge
infrastructure that effortlessly scales to millions of users. The platform
equips you with a set of powerful tools such as our
[REST API](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints),
[webhooks](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/webhooks),
[schema validation](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/schema-validation),
analytics, and more.
